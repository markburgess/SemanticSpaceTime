SEMANTIC SPACETIME

The programs in this repository accompany a series of blog posts.
They are meant as pedagogical examples, not necessarily as production
quality reference implementations. 

The examples assume that you have ArangoDB and golang installed
locally on your Linux based computer, as described in Part 2 of the
series.

To keep the reasoning clear, I've simplfied error handling in many
cases. Use these to learn, but be aware that additional cases and
checks might be needed for stress testing applications.

To link the package to your golang installation, you can create a symbolic link

   ln -s ~/path/SemanticSpacetime/pkg/SST ~/go/src/SST

sst.go   - put some data into a graph using the SST library

doors.go - model and analyze a causal process (see blog) using the SST library
scatter.go - run after doors.go to show coarse grains with symmetrical scatter
scatter2.go - run after doors.go to show aggregated grains

scan.go  - NLP scan a document and turn its parts into a simple graph database
           e.g. go run scan.go obama.dat

query.go - query the database based on search terms and show stories

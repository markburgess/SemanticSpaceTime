This example opens a pipe from the Linux traceroute program, with default settings.

  go run traceroute.go  google.com

Traceroute makes three parallel pings to each location along the route
and reports on the addresses that come back. If the route hits some
kind of load balancer, then different addresses will be reported. These are joined
by a hub node to show that they belong to the same organization. If
the router blocks ICMP packets then * is returned.  The program
collects the outputs and organizes them, linking parallel addresses,
and chains of * * * into "wormholes" of a certain path length.
The graph can be observed by plotting the full graph in Arango. It should have
a snake-like thread from beginning to end.

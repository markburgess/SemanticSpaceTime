We will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken

What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility -- a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task

This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed -- why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall, and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath

Our  journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated  like anyone else under the law â€“- applause -- for if we are truly  created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be  equal as well

Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to  welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a  land of opportunity -- applause -- until bright young students and  engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our  country

We must act, knowing that  todays victories will be only partial and that it will be up to those  who stand here in four years and years and years hence to  advance the timeless spirit once conferred to us in a spare  Philadelphia hall

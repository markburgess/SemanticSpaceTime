Two recent works have shed light on the role of infrastructure in the
scaling of functional systems.  The observation of universal, scale
free behaviours, both in observed data, and in a `mean field'
description of cities, and the observation, in
biology, of metabolic scaling laws for organisms, following a
century of observation. Both of these were explained from
the behaviours of their internal networks.

Cities are an example of collaborative community networks, where
humans and technology mix within a semantically (i.e.  functionally)
rich space, equipped with infrastructure. One may ask how cities
differ from apparently similar communities across different scales,
including tribes, collectives, companies, software installations, and
even countries.  Understanding the dominant processes that make these
shared environments smart, creative, and productive, is a worthy
investment, given how 21st century life relies on them so much for its
success and survival.

In this note, I review and build on Bettencourt's model of
cities\cite{bettencourt1, and discuss its implications for pervasive
information technology (IT). By building on the lessons of cities, I
hope to to foster a better understanding of a broader range of
functional systems, especially in information technology, while trying
to preserve the simplicity of Bettencourt's arguments. I begin by
summarizing an interpretation that lays the foundations for a more
microscopic formulation of the model, using promise
theory\cite{promisebook. The latter may be used to relate outcomes to
intentions and mechanisms, in a way that respects the idea of scaling.


Bettencourt's model of scaling in cities summarized


This section is a review (and trivial generalization) of the city
scaling arguments, and data used by Bettencourt and collaborators at
the Santa Fe Institute (SFI) \cite{bettencourt1, bettencourt2,
  bettencourt3, in a form suitable for comparison with other work. In
section \ref{pt, I propose a deeper justification for the model, with
some embellishments.  Some interpretations may be my own.

Scaling phenomenology

Measurable attributes, of finite dynamical systems, typically scale
in proportion to some measure of their size. Size may refer to the
number of agents $N$ (persons) in the system, or per unit volume $V$
of the system, and $N$ and $V$ may or may not be related. This is a
point of view that is a basic tool of analysis in physical systems.
For cities, $N$ is used as the scaling variable.  Across an ensemble
of many systems of different size, the measurements one obtains may
scale in three broad ways (see figure \ref{scalingz):

\begin{enumerate
\item Sublinear scaling of quantities $q$ of the infrastructure
  machinery $q \propto N^{\beta<1$. This indicates economies of
  scale, because, as the system size grows, the cost becomes
  relatively cheaper. In cities, it is observed to apply to the transport
  networks that animate the system (arterial systems, roads, cables,
  petrol stations, etc).

\item Linear scaling, simply proportional to the number $q \propto
  N^{\beta = 1$.  In cities, this seems to apply to direct
  consumption of goods and resources per capita (jobs, houses, water
  consumption, etc).

\item Superlinear yields of produce or `output', where $q \propto
  N^{\beta > 1$, which is driven by interactivity between the parts
  of the system and its consequences (wages, rents, patents, crime,
  disease, GDP).  If a process rate is superlinear, then the
  corresponding time for the process to run will be sublinear, and
  vice versa.
\end{enumerate
It is of particular interest when these patterns seem to apply across
such a broad range of scales. This suggests some emergent
{\em universality, whose origin and mechanism is worth understanding.  

As part of a protracted project to uncover the behaviours of cities or
urban metropolitan districts, Bettencourt has proposed a mean field model to
explain observed scaling behaviour of certain economic measures,
making only elementary assumptions about the processes
within\cite{bettencourt1.  The model predicts the main features of
the data, by assuming a dynamical universality, but seems to fall short of
describing the full range of observed scaling exponents $\beta$.
Empirical data from \cite{bettencourt2 revealed sublinear, linear,
and superlinear scaling behaviour in the variety of accessible data.
The data came initially from mostly American cities (see table
\ref{innovtab), and have since been demonstrated in European cities
in \cite{bettencourt4. All cities, thus far, have a more or less
comparable level of technological development, and thus fit plausibly
into a statistical ensemble.

Cities are not just dynamical systems, they also exhibit complex
semantics, or purposeful, intentional, patterned behaviours.  In the
physics of inanimate systems, the markers of semantics are comprised
of only a few simple labels; charges, force laws, and interaction
graphs.  These are constant over time, and accepted as universal
`physical law'.  However, in human functional systems, the range of
interactions, and their assumed meanings, is much richer, and may
depend of time and context.  Coarse graining, by creating a mean field
model, is a standard physical approach which eliminates the types,
labels, and other semantics of networks, and exposes the universality
of scaling phenomena. However, this simplicity is a trade-off:
semantics are also what sustains the arrangement and composition of
functional processes, at a deeper level, and could lead to actionable
predictions. 

In these notes, I show how semantics provide some additional
structure and constraints on dynamics, and how both short and long
range interactions may be distinguished through functional dependency.
This leads to a possible explanation for the discrepancy between data and
predictions of superlinear scaling exponents in



Definitions

Consider a city, in the coarsest approximation, as a bounded
homogenous mass, sustained by external supplies and internally
generated wealth.  This is analogous to a model of gravity and
pressure versus volume, whose equilibrium defines an average city
size. Bettencourt likens the arrangement to a star, which gravitates
together from the benefits of city infrastructure, and expands through the
accretion of new inhabitants.

The city is populated by $N$ inhabitants, which I will call `agents',
which and may include machines, animals, etc., or any proxies for
human intent that lead to economic output. The data on cities, used in
the comparison, are based on human population numbers, so $N$ will
refer to the people, in the first approximation.  The agents are
distributed within a volume $V$, in $D$ dimensions. Cities are more or
less two dimensional ($D=2$), in spite of high rise regions, because
the more or less 1 dimensional networks connecting them lie mainly in
a plane.

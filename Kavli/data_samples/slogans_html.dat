<span 
class="ptmb7t-x-x-172">Prologue</span>
</p><!--l. 213--><p class="indent" >  Poverty, suspicion and then violence: three wretched bed-fellows that stalk us,
waiting to split society open, as if with an axe to the skull. It is a direct aﬀront to
civilization.
</p><!--l. 217--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Damn the politicians for their incompetence!</span>
</p><!--l. 219--><p class="indent" >  Looking out across the darkness of Birkelunden Park, old Arne&#x2019;s shadow trembles
in the doorway, like an earthquake with the palsy. The evening is not cold, not even
here at the breezy entrance to the vestibule; it&#x2019;s mostly his nerves—that and the
spectre of a pestilence, invading his neighbourhood.
</p><!--l. 225--><p class="indent" >  Behind him, the church steeple thrusts up into a darkened sky, groping for a realm
of higher grace, one that is immune to these stains on civic decency. It makes for a
chilling contrast to see this perversion of civil society so close to hallowed ground, so
close to the safety of home.
</p><!--l. 231--><p class="indent" >  His gaze follows the two down-and-outs, pushing their plastic newspaper cart,
leaden with shopping bags. Where did they steal that? And what&#x2019;s in those bags?
Look at them! They disgust him. Bickering like a couple of ten year olds,
probably over whatever money they have managed to extort from decent
folk, they mumble with that distant and petulant slur of persistent substance
abuse.
</p><!--l. 238--><p class="indent" >  The contrast disturbs all possible sensibility. The quiet beauty of the park with its
empty bandstand and simple drinking fountain, the austerity of the old trees, the
tidiness of the bushes and grass: they are all symbols of Man&#x2019;s great achievement: the
refrain from opportunistic violence, participation in the order of self-discipline
towards the common good: Civil Society. It is demeaned by this vulgar show.
These people are drop-outs by choice. Any man can have a job, if he wants
one.
</p><!--l. 247--><p class="indent" >  Arne views these events from across the threshold, drawn by the tram-lines, sensing
that something is about to happen. The world is falling apart on nights like this, but
they tell him he is just a foolish old man, fearful of shadows and of change.
The sceptics should be here now to see this. Tonight, for once, his fears are

conﬁrmed.
</p><!--l. 253--><p class="indent" >  An immigrant man, with greying hair, probably of Pakistani origin, approaches the
couple from the nearby tram station. He&#x2019;s quite well dressed. At least one can say that
about these immigrants.
</p><!--l. 257--><p class="indent" >  “Hey there, chief,” says the dark-skinned man to the couple.
</p><!--l. 259--><p class="indent" >  At ﬁrst they ignore him, but the man persists in his salutation. They look at him
sullenly, more concerned with whining to each other than bothering with him. The
woman is trying to get the man to give her something—looks like a key from a big
key ring, but he is like a sulky child. They are his keys. They are important to him. He
is not going to give them up easily. He must be thirty but he looks forty-ﬁve. They are
down-and-out. They are like children.
</p><!--l. 267--><p class="indent" >  “So, chief. Are you some sort of a security chief? What you got all those keys
for?”
</p><!--l. 270--><p class="indent" >  The man&#x2019;s scruﬀy belt bulges under his ﬂeece jacket with the huge key ring; it has
dozens of keys on it. It shines in comparison to his ﬁlthy, old clothes, and pasty-grey,
unshaven face, or what little of it shows from behind his shoulder-length shaggy hair.
At the mention of the keys, he looks up.
</p><!--l. 276--><p class="indent" >  “What&#x2019;s it to you?”
</p><!--l. 278--><p class="indent" >  The keys are probably just ﬂea-market memorabilia; collecting them is likely what
passes for a hobby for the hobo, but that possibility seems to escape their
provocateur. He is haunted by the daemons of an experience that is not available to
the onlookers. The Paki comes closer. He is smartly dressed in suit trousers
with a white shirt. He looks nervous or agitated, although it is diﬃcult to tell
from this distance—and you can never tell what the hell these foreigners are
thinking
</p><!--l. 287--><p class="indent" >  “What do you need all those keys for?” he asks.
</p><!--l. 289--><p class="indent" >  The man shrugs. If his face were not so deadened with years of abuse, one might
have seen a quizzical expression on it. “They&#x2019;re just keys.”
</p><!--l. 293--><p class="indent" >  “Keys, eh? What does someone like you need so many keys for?”
</p><!--l. 295--><p class="indent" >  The down-and-out glares at him and pushes the woman aside, as if to leave. He
does not care to reply to the man. His consciousness of the situation has already
dissolved into the numbness of his intoxication. There is neither understanding of the
question nor emotional engagement in the encounter.
</p><!--l. 301--><p class="indent" >  The dark man&#x2019;s querying expression changes abruptly to one of accusation. “If you
come anywhere near my home, I&#x2019;ll bloody kill you!”
</p><!--l. 305--><p class="indent" >  The threat of this outburst merits a glance, at least. “What???” Down-and-out steps
back a step in surprise.
</p><!--l. 308--><p class="indent" >  The well-dressed refugee comes closer, posed more threateningly. “I&#x2019;m not afraid
of you!” he shouts, suddenly angry for no reason and clearly lying. He pulls his shirt
up, revealing a hammer stuﬀed into his trousers. “See this? You&#x2019;re a bloody drug
addict! My apartment has been broken into four times! If you come back again, I&#x2019;ll
get you! I&#x2019;m not afraid.”
</p><!--l. 315--><p class="indent" >  “Fuck oﬀ! Just ignore him,” says the woman, repacking her plastic bags for no

apparent reason.
</p><!--l. 318--><p class="indent" >  He takes the hammer out of his trousers. “You&#x2019;re simple! You&#x2019;re bloody simple!”
the man shouts. “I&#x2019;ll get you if you come near my family!”
</p><!--l. 322--><p class="indent" >  “They&#x2019;re keys,” the man replies. “I&#x2019;ll kill you with . . . a single. . .”
</p><!--l. 325--><p class="indent" >  He is a ghostly pale man in ﬁlthy clothes. He can hardly stand up, let alone muster a
punch.
</p><!--l. 328--><p class="indent" >  “Can&#x2019;t you just leave us alone?” the woman sneers.
</p><!--l. 330--><p class="indent" >  “He&#x2019;s a bloody drug addict!” cries the dark-skinned man, as if in conﬁrmation. He
looks around him as if to involve onlookers and seek their conﬁrmation. He has pulled
out the hammer now and is gesticulating with it dangerously.
</p><!--l. 335--><p class="indent" >  “What&#x2019;s it to you?”
</p><!--l. 337--><p class="indent" >  Arne&#x2019;s heart is beating quickly now. He has not seen a violent incident in this city –
not even in his home country – since his days doing his national service. He has never
seen anyone brandish a weapon.
</p><!--l. 342--><p class="indent" >  The two down-and-outs shuﬄe slightly backwards into the darkness of the park,
trying not to cause a scene, but the man has already attracted the attention of the
people on the street. This is a busy residential area where people go to bars and
cafes. Even in this laissez-faire country people would notice something like
this.
</p><!--l. 348--><p class="indent" >  A ﬁgure in his ﬁeld of vision is talking into his mobile.
</p><!--l. 350--><p class="indent" >  So lashes the tail of diabolical intervention. Two ﬁgures emerge from the cover of
night; they are large and their heads are shaven. Their clothing is disrespectfully
contrary to fashion or style, jackets tied around their waists and nothing but T-shirts
and faded jeans to cover them. One of them has a beer towel sewn on to his jeans as if
for corporate sponsorship. They wear the German swastika tattooed onto their bare
arms. They are moving rapidly, purposefully, almost running, as though responding to
a ﬁre. They are carrying bottles of beer on the streets. That is illegal at best, Arne
thinks.
</p><!--l. 360--><p class="indent" >  Without introduction, challenge or warning, the leader shouts: “You fucking wop!”,
and strikes the Pakistani over the head with his bottle. The man has not seen
them coming. He falls to the ground bleeding and the skinhead kicks him
for good measure, though it hardly seems relevant. He is barely moving.
“Fuck oﬀ home!” the leader shouts, bending over him, as if the man is in
a ﬁt state to understand his words. “Fucking wop!” His sidekick imitates
his brutish pose, both of the standing over what increasingly resembles a
corpse.
</p><!--l. 370--><p class="indent" >  People waiting for the tram are beginning to look nervous, woken by the act. They
are wondering whether they should intervene or call the police or just get out of
there. This lightning bolt of obscenity has paralyzed them. They cannot quite
believe this is here in their world. Where did these ﬁgures come from? How
did this situation escalate so quickly from ignorable poverty to threatening
violence?
</p><!--l. 378--><p class="indent" >  Arne reels. My god, he thinks, all that he holds dear! Everything he has,

everything that matters—it could all be broken, twisted and smashed in a
single instant of primitive reﬂex. This is terror of the worst kind! Against
ourselves!
</p><!--l. 383--><p class="indent" >  He falls back into the entrance of the church, wondering whether the youngsters
talking into the mobiles called the police or whether they called the attackers. Tremors
dominate his thoughts, as his own fragility is so brutally and graphically explained to
him.
</p><!--l. 388--><p class="indent" >  They are out there: the homeless, the drug addicts, the simple, the fearful, the ones
who do know how to ﬁt in, the ones who are expelled without tolerance. They are
lurking in the sidelines, waiting to explode; a ticking time bomb, threatening the very
fabric of society. An enemy within.
</p><!--l. 394--><p class="indent" >  Arne is white and breathless now. They inﬁltrate our hallowed places, the very
symbols of our civilization! They are where we least expect them to be, he gibbers in
his mind. They brew the fear that makes us hate, the fear that leads to addiction, to
that same poverty of thought, and to violence itself. How far has Man come in our
world, only to be stopped by this?
</p><!--l. 401--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">What is the point of it all, if such a wound can bleed our very security?</span>
</p><!--l. 403--><p class="indent" >  Crystallizing in his panic, he watches the scene coldly, with a bitter fear, without
interfering, without helping, without speaking up, without acting on his distress,
without breathing or caring enough to act, without changing society or resolving to
make it a better place. Instead, his emotion turns to hate and he turns inward. The
righteous will prevail without his intervention.

</p><!--l. 420--><p class="indent" >  Sara Vibeke Stensrud (best known to her friends as Vibe) marvels at the little town
from the train station, as she fumbles a heavy backpack into place on her skinny
frame. She takes pause, only for a second, to appreciate the change in surroundings.
For weeks, she has been stuck in an oﬃce, playing with sterile computer programs;
now here, with the wind on her face and the sun in her eyes, she can ﬁnally sense that
she is part of the world.
</p><!--l. 428--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">This is a real place.</span>
</p><!--l. 430--><p class="indent" >  Very cool indeed. It&#x2019;s like ﬁnding a world, in VR, where things are going on
even though you are not there to see them. People actually live here and stuﬀ
changes by itself; and now, she gets to sample the delights, interact with the
characters.
</p><!--l. 435--><p class="indent" >  The little station is idyllic, even friendly; newly painted railings show an attention
to detail and a caring warmth, despite the icy mountain wind. She texts a
quick message to Bea, even as she fumbles with her sack, to say “Duh!”
and snaps a picture of the scene with her glasses, sending it along with the
message.
</p><!--l. 441--><p class="indent" >  Like agony aunts, doom-saying inevitable plastic surgery, they have been betting on
what the little town would look like after its shoe-shine. Face it, Bea&#x2019;s roots were once
pulled out of countryside and are now replanted in deepest Urbania; given a podium,
she can talk for, well minutes actually, describing the mausoleums of badly-painted
wooden houses, prefabricated concrete boxes and other delights to be found out here.
Norway might be known for its natural beauty, but not for its architectural
prowess.
</p><!--l. 450--><p class="indent" >  In a moment, the train behind her will pull away and Vibe will be on her own,
maybe even for the next few days. So friendly is good. It looks even a little homey, but
it doesn&#x2019;t quite feel like home. She smiles playfully and texts Bea: “In love, will stay
here and raise kids,” and she adds a wink.
</p><!--l. 456--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Are we ready?</span>

</p><!--l. 458--><p class="indent" >  All right then.
</p><!--l. 460--><p class="indent" >  The sun&#x2019;s halting disc beams down from autumn cobalt. Flags ﬂutter like mainsails,
catching a rush of icicles streaming oﬀ the mountain. The shuttle-train has been
shielding her from it so far, but in an instant the deceptive clemency will show its
fangs, ever ready to suck the warmth from the unwary. Time to get moving before she
catches her death.
</p><!--l. 467--><p class="indent" >  She removes her glasses—a little vanity that she enjoys: ﬂirting with eye-wear in
public places. No use for them on the mountain perhaps, but still good to have. Then
her mobile beeps a message back at her. It&#x2019;s from Bea. It says “Duh!” and has a smile!
Vibe grins and rolls her eyes at her own silliness.
</p><!--l. 474--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Bury my mobile</span>! she smiles to herself. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Anyway, here we are, ready to make the trek</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">into the mountains. Oﬀ we go.</span>
</p><!--l. 478--><p class="indent" >  Ambivalence simmers. She has not exactly become ﬂavour of the month for
deciding to come out here. “Go!” “Don&#x2019;t go!” they said. What was that all
about? For her, the trip is part nostalgia, partly survival, and partly a sense
of adventure, rekindled. And, of course, there was one thing that clinched
it.
</p><!--l. 484--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">But we won&#x2019;t talk about that one for now. . .</span>
</p><!--l. 486--><p class="indent" >  She pulls up a local map on her wristband and checks directions. She&#x2019;ll probably
have to get a taxi from here to the start of the path up the mountain. Too far to walk all
the way.
</p><!--l. 490--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Besides there&#x2019;ll be enough walking in the next few days to give Ghandi blisters. .</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">.</span>
</p><!--l. 493--><p class="indent" >  Vibe ﬂicks through some menus with her thumb and dials the number of the
team leader. The charmingly way-too-slow voice at the other end is clearly a
machine, or else Mrs. Laurent has been doing drugs. “Hello, Mrs. Laurent?
This is Sara Stensrud. Just letting you know that I have arrived at the train
station and should be with you tomorrow. I&#x2019;ll call again from the cabin this
evening.”
</p><!--l. 500--><p class="indent" >  Vibe pulls her backpack straps tighter and extricates her long, mousy ponytail from
the rigging. She heads to the station exit.
</p><!--l. 503--><p class="indent" >  Her wrist signals again and her hand has palmed the strap before she realizes that
she has no self-control. The message is a form from the research council, for her travel
expenses. Useful, but late. Famous government bureaucracy — as timely as a
tortoise on stilts. It should pretty much ﬁll itself out, so she just ﬂicks through,
accepting its terms. Approval from her advisor is already there; there will
have to be conﬁrmation from Brussels before she can start the spending. . .
blablabla. Fine. It&#x2019;s better than nothing. She squeezes ‘send&#x2019; and does not
wait for conﬁrmation before ﬂipping over to send a quick one-liner to her
advisor.
</p><!--l. 514--><p class="indent" >  Then something odd. The display freezes with a quickly ﬂashed message “alpha
send” or some such crap, and then the display returns with a ‘battery low&#x2019; signal. It
was charged on the train.

</p><!--l. 518--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">What Is The Matter With You, Fone?</span>
</p><!--l. 520--><p class="indent" >  That&#x2019;s Swedish technology for you.
</p><!--l. 522--><p class="indent" >  Impatient, she drops the M thing into her pocket and descends the short ﬂight of
steps at the station exit. She begins to cross the road. She has other appendages she
can use. Besides, it is starting to rule her life. So Vibe looks up, glad to see something
other than her wrist for once.
</p><!--l. 528--><p class="indent" >  Two cars are parked over by the old car pumps. One of them has a darkened police
light on top. A woman in uniform stands by as a man unloads some plastic cartons
from it. He glances at her and holds the glance for just a moment too long, as if guilt
obliges him.
</p><!--l. 533--><p class="indent" >  There is a shop at the pumps, with food and supplies and stuﬀ. She needs to pick up
a few things: a little junk, some snacks. She trots towards it, ignoring them. The
brooding urgency of city concerns seems to have lifted from her in this unfamiliar
territory. The burden of worry is replaced by the pragmatism of the moment. Travel is
useful that way: it rubs out pointless intricacies and replaces them with broad strokes
of necessity.
</p><!--l. 541--><p class="indent" >  Inside the shop, life is predictably pedestrian. A lone teenager is sitting by
the checkout of the mini-mart, dividing his attention between a TV and a
security monitor. It could be a scene preserved from twenty years earlier, she
thinks. A museum piece, unaware of its own failure to accede to the passage of
time.
</p><!--l. 547--><p class="indent" >  His eyes ﬁx elsewhere as she enters, but he sees every aspect of his world go by on
a monitor screen in front of him. Those four corners are his world, she imagines. And
what a predictable and thankless world is framed within it. Only after she has her back
to him does she see him turn to give her the once over, in the reﬂection of a glass door.
Well: hot girl—who wouldn&#x2019;t?
</p><!--l. 554--><p class="indent" >  Her brother always used to say that, in small incestuous places like this, the whole
village must be vampires, because if there were even one then everyone would be
bitten by now. He&#x2019;s certainly pale enough, and he hasn&#x2019;t moved much yet, but . . . this
is no time for a stake-out.
</p><!--l. 560--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Bite me! </span>she smiles.
</p><!--l. 562--><p class="indent" >  She grabs stuﬀ from the shelves without out stopping to browse. She has most of
what she needs—just a little snack for the trip up the mountain. Maybe a new battery
for the M thing, in case something is actually wrong with it. A bottle of water for
later.
</p><!--l. 567--><p class="indent" >  At the checkout, the kid seems kind of cute—or would be if he were ﬁve years
older. She pulls a few hair strands loose from her pony tail, enjoying the eﬀect it has
on him. She is used to having boys look at her. Most of them shouldn&#x2019;t be
looking, but this one deserves to think about her later on, when he&#x2019;s alone. He&#x2019;ll
ripen.
</p><!--l. 573--><p class="indent" >  Racing now. Outside again, she sees the town from the opposing viewpoint.
The towering mountains in the background make it a depressing oasis of
concrete stonewall, colourless against the powerful rock-faces and forested

ascents. It has been only a year since she was last here, but the power of it is
still haunting. She feels tiny. Better to get up there before she changes her
mind.
</p><!--l. 580--><p class="indent" >  Her mobile ﬂinches again and the car with the police light pulls up as she
approaches the crossing. The second car has gone, or is out of sight. A woman,
dressed up in a badly ﬁtting uniform gets out and approaches her. Her stoney face is
pointy and thin; she is too darkly tanned and her hair is pulled back so tightly in a
pony tail that it looks like a Do-It-Yourself face-lift.
</p><!--l. 587--><p class="indent" >  “ID?” she queries ﬂatly — gracious Nordic charity.
</p><!--l. 589--><p class="indent" >  Vibe touches her ID-send, and the woman reads of the details on her mobile. “Got
her” she says monotonically to the wire in her ear. She does not even look at Vibe.
“Unlikely.”
</p><!--l. 593--><p class="indent" >  “Excuse me?”
</p><!--l. 595--><p class="indent" >  “You&#x2019;re going up the mountain?”
</p><!--l. 597--><p class="indent" >  “Uh huh.”
</p><!--l. 599--><p class="indent" >  “Hmmm.” She is entering something on her mobile.
</p><!--l. 601--><p class="indent" >  “Is there something wrong with that? Is there something I should know?”
</p><!--l. 603--><p class="indent" >  “You can&#x2019;t go up there yet. There&#x2019;s a disturbance. Police operation.”
</p><!--l. 605--><p class="indent" >  “What kind of disturbance?”
</p><!--l. 607--><p class="indent" >  She pauses for too long. “Gangs on the loose.”
</p><!--l. 609--><p class="indent" >  “Gangs?”
</p><!--l. 611--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s what I said.”
</p><!--l. 613--><p class="indent" >  “But I came here to go up there. What kind of gangs?”
</p><!--l. 615--><p class="indent" >  The police woman looks at her with eyes that are too wide. Must be a zombie, or a
vampire. “Sign in at mountain rescue, while you&#x2019;re waiting, and don&#x2019;t make any
trouble here.”
</p><!--l. 619--><p class="indent" >  “What? I just arrived.”
</p><!--l. 621--><p class="indent" >  “How long do you plan being up there?”
</p><!--l. 623--><p class="indent" >  “A few days. maybe a week. What did you mean ‘got her&#x2019;?”
</p><!--l. 625--><p class="indent" >  “You see the car parked over there just now?” She points to the place where Vibe
saw the cars parked.
</p><!--l. 628--><p class="indent" >  She shakes her head and shrugs, lying. No sense in asking for trouble.
</p><!--l. 630--><p class="indent" >  “We&#x2019;re doing stop-searches in the area.”
</p><!--l. 632--><p class="indent" >  Vibe shrugs and smiles on the inside.
</p><!--l. 634--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">She&#x2019;s doing a little alcohol trade on the side! Hah. She knows I saw her.</span>
</p><!--l. 637--><p class="indent" >  The woman looks her up and down. “Just doing our job. Don&#x2019;t go up there until you
get the okay signal from mountain rescue.” She looks her up and down once more and
runs some kind of scanner over her backpack, checking twice. Then she just says
“okay” and gets back into her police car.
</p><!--l. 643--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">It is not even a real police car. It&#x2019;s just her single-mother bang-wagon with a stupid</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">light on top.</span>
</p><!--l. 647--><p class="indent" >  As she drives oﬀ, Vibe notices a child seat in the back of the car.
</p><!--l. 650--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">So they are arresting kids now. Bitch</span>.

</p><!--l. 652--><p class="indent" >  She reels in a local map on her M thing and starts heading towards a taxi that is
parked across at the station. So they made the town shine again with a lick of paint
and some nice weather, but she doesn&#x2019;t think she&#x2019;ll stay and have kids here after
all.
</p><!--l. 658--><p class="indent" >  A single drop of October rain lands on her face, from out nowhere, as if protesting
against the unusually long summer mildness, and the failure of autumn to supplant it
with any convincing charade of its own. It is a signal for her to hasten her resolve.
Besides, the backpack is feeling heavier than she imagined. It will either kill her or do
wonders for her stomach contours.
</p><!--l. 665--><p class="indent" >  She texts another ridiculous message and sighs, bored with her own habit. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Okay –</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">now we&#x2019;re sick of the mobile</span>, she thinks and puts it away.
</p><!--l. 669--><p class="indent" >  Stupid invention. So stupid, so necessary.

</p><!--l. 672--><p class="noindent" >*</p></div>
<!--l. 676--><p class="indent" >  Vibe checks in at the information centre. It is a pokey wooden bungalow with large
windows, decorated in predictable Norwegian wood and linoleum ﬂooring, which
tapers towards a plastic drain in the middle of the ﬂoor—almost as though
they are expecting someone to take a shower right there in the middle of the
room.
</p><!--l. 682--><p class="indent" >  The centre is run by a skinny stick-boy, probably a college student, maybe her
own age, and a bulbous fat woman, who is squeezed way too tightly into her
blouse.
</p><!--l. 686--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">No grace in denial.</span>
</p><!--l. 688--><p class="indent" >  Vibe approaches the desk. They see her, but no-one comes to her aid.
</p><!--l. 691--><p class="indent" >  It is deadly quiet in the room. It is deadly quiet outside. Probably, they
see only two people in a whole day at this time of year, but they keep her
waiting.
</p><!--l. 695--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Hey, freaky college student person!</span>
</p><!--l. 697--><p class="indent" >  Stick Boy is showing Fat Lady something about the combo workstation on her
desk. Something tells her that the ugly one is in charge. Sara decides to put on her
glasses, something that makes her look more ordinary, in case her startling good looks
should weigh to her disadvantage here.
</p><!--l. 703--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Hello? </span>Echoes repeating. . . <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I&#x2019;m here.</span>
</p><!--l. 706--><p class="indent" >  She is not used to being ignored, but she knows enough to recognize when it is
deliberate. She turns and browses the information room, looking at maps and leaﬂets
to distract herself from the wait. Best not to lose one&#x2019;s temper and get oﬀ on the
wrong foot.
</p><!--l. 711--><p class="indent" >  <span

</p><!--l. 714--><p class="indent" >  “Do you need any help?” asks the woman, eventually.
</p><!--l. 716--><p class="indent" >  “Yes please!” <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Suppress urgent need for sarcasm. </span>“I am going up into the hills. I&#x2019;m
supposed to check in with mountain rescue.”
</p><!--l. 719--><p class="indent" >  The woman greets her with an edge of disapproval. “Well. You can&#x2019;t go up there
now. There&#x2019;s a police operation operation going on.”
</p><!--l. 722--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Headline, lady: button fatigue causes fat explosion. Danger of deep-frying village.</span>
“I heard,” she says. “What&#x2019;s it about?”
</p><!--l. 726--><p class="indent" >  “Some idiots with toy guns are playing up there.”
</p><!--l. 728--><p class="indent" >  “Toy guns?” She articulates the words incredulously.
</p><!--l. 730--><p class="indent" >  “Paint balls or something,” says the student, joining them at the counter. “They are
having some kind of war games up there. The cabins are on alert.”
</p><!--l. 733--><p class="indent" >  “Police don&#x2019;t do anything,” says the woman. “They should throw them all in jail.”
She smiles sullenly.
</p><!--l. 736--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Seems pleasant enough. Could have misjudged.</span>
</p><!--l. 738--><p class="indent" >  A thought occurs to Vibe. Could there be a connection between this information
and the reason for her visit here? Her babies are not answering like they are supposed
to. How come no one told her about this before?
</p><!--l. 743--><p class="indent" >  “So what&#x2019;s the prognosis?” Vibe asks. “How long is it going to take?”
</p><!--l. 745--><p class="indent" >  The woman pouts. “Hard to say.”
</p><!--l. 747--><p class="indent" >  “Hours? Days?”
</p><!--l. 749--><p class="indent" >  “You shouldn&#x2019;t get too excited. These things can take time. There is a big area to
cover. They are trying to get a helicopter, but the budget has been cut so they don&#x2019;t
like using it.”
</p><!--l. 753--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">How dangerous could it be?</span>
</p><!--l. 755--><p class="indent" >  The mountains are a pretty big place, but that also works in her favour. The chances
of her meeting these idiots is pretty small. Besides, it couldn&#x2019;t be any worse than Oslo
on a Saturday night. . .
</p><!--l. 760--><p class="indent" >  Vibe uncovers her wrist-mobile and says: “Is there somewhere I can wait?”
</p><!--l. 763--><p class="indent" >  The woman hits a place on the touch screen to scan Vibe&#x2019;s ID and expected route.
Vibe&#x2019;s mobile signals approval of her route. “There&#x2019;s a café just down the road here,
on the second ﬂoor of the supermarket. They have services, so if you follow our
information,” (she taps another touch-pad to oﬀer the URI to Vibe&#x2019;s mobile), “you
should get the same information we have.”
</p><!--l. 770--><p class="indent" >  “Thanks,” she says. “Maybe I&#x2019;ll do that.” The words trickle out innocently enough,
but every ﬁbre of her being screams: Lady, you must be out of your mind if you think
I am going to that concrete bunker to consume your lousy coﬀee and perfumed
cakes.
</p><!--l. 776--><p class="indent" >  “Bye then.”
</p><!--l. 778--><p class="indent" >  Succumbing to an urge to ﬂee this little time warp, Vibe heads out into the sunshine
to make the most of the day. If she cannot do as she pleases then she can
at least enjoy the moment. She toys with the idea of visiting the café, but
rejects it swiftly. She does not have the funds to extend her stay here. It is out
of the question to spend the night here. She needs to get up the mountain.

Today.
</p><!--l. 785--><p class="indent" >  Vibe walks towards a little square in the town. A pair of tête à tête park benches are
getting some sunshine so she drops her backpack onto one of them and sits down to
absorb some questionably healthy solar radiation.
</p><!--l. 790--><p class="indent" >  As a city girl, she despises the small-town isolation of this place: the unadventurous
paranoia about the outside world, the unreasonable contentment with what they have,
the blinkered fantasy that their way of life is better. But she can also be bigger than
that. She has seen enough to know that there is something charming and idyllic about
a small-town life. The mountains almost embrace this little town as if forming a
crucible to hold it, that gazes up at the sky. This is their prison, but also their
paradise.
</p><!--l. 800--><p class="indent" >  But she is a city girl, with no question or doubt. That is her instinct and it is
her image; and a good image is the best way to keep one&#x2019;s personality from
overﬂowing.
</p><!--l. 804--><p class="indent" >  From the bench she stares forward at the mountain face in the direction
that she must travel. It looms over her with impossible size, so close and
yet so reduced to be squeezed into her ﬁeld of vision. Each gigantic tree
on the rocky slope is clearly visible, yet surreal in its insigniﬁcance; and
the cold rock slowly reveals its intransigence. The longer she gazes at it,
the more the picture-postcard idyll transforms into merciless and deﬁant
threat.
</p><!--l. 812--><p class="indent" >  A momentary twinge of foreboding grips her. Turn back! She suppresses it as
swiftly as it surfaces. She will not think of irrelevant unlikelihoods now. She is above
such things. She is Sara Stensrud and she can do whatever she puts her mind to.
It is time to go up the mountain, ﬂouting peril, dodging the dark forces of
fate.
</p><!--l. 819--><p class="indent" >  She texts to Bea: <span

<!--l. 826--><p class="indent" >  Vibe kicks through dry, powdering leaves—a tossed salad of multi-coloured
hand-prints, fracturing and disintegrating into the earth: vampires that saw sunlight.
The road from the little town is narrow and straight; trees stand on parade
at either side, ﬂaunting their autumnal pomp and ﬁnery as if saluting her
journey.
</p><!--l. 833--><p class="indent" >  She tries to call her contact, Mrs. Laurent, once again, but there is still no reply. She
gives up and simply marches onward. Better to be up ‘there&#x2019; with something to do,
than down ‘here&#x2019; in the dark, she thinks.
</p><!--l. 838--><p class="indent" >  It takes her half an hour to reach the end of the trail, as it curves and winds, up an
down, ending in what looks like a farm. A farmhouse is situated just oﬀ the road. Her

mobile tells her that the path up the mountain starts here. In the distance she can see
the densely forested valley rise, meandering upward to some snowy peaks
beyond.
</p><!--l. 844--><p class="indent" >  Vibe comes to a tractor trail, close to the farmhouse; she can see the metal
bridge over the stream that&#x2019;s marked on the map and the actual trail that winds
around almost full-circle to avoid an old stone wall, blocked oﬀ by a fence.
The fence is buckled slightly where hikers have jumped over it, rather than
following the path around as they should. She could follow her conscience and
take the muddy path along the stone slabs, but the ford she would have to
cross looks like a recipe for getting pretty wet and a poor way to start her
trip.
</p><!--l. 854--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Stupid place to put a fence anyway</span>, she thinks.
</p><!--l. 856--><p class="indent" >  The fence then.
</p><!--l. 858--><p class="indent" >  A man, oﬀ in the distance, next to a barn, shouts to her. She turns and squints to
look at him. The sound of his voice echoes around the farmyard a little, and is
otherwise lost in the void. it does not make much sense to her, but she can
see that he is gesticulating, pointing with a ﬁnger. She is not sure what he
is saying, but she can guess and she sure as hell doesn&#x2019;t care much for his
tone.
</p><!--l. 866--><p class="indent" >  He is reminding her that she should follow the path.
</p><!--l. 869--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Guess again, mate</span>, she thinks. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Had you asked me nicely. . .</span>
</p><!--l. 871--><p class="indent" >  Besides, Sara Vibeke Stensrud is used to getting her way.
</p><!--l. 873--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I am a spoiled child</span>, she thinks. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">That gives me certain rights.</span>
</p><!--l. 875--><p class="indent" >  She pushes down the thin wire that is already ruined and begins to climb over it. It
is not too high, but there is an elasticity to it that makes it non-trivial to keep it down
as she swings her backpack-laden form over it. Her stomach muscles give a satisfying
scream of stress, indicating that her stomach will be hard and muscular after this
trip.
</p><!--l. 882--><p class="indent" >  As she tumbles onto the grass on the other side, she checks on him and sees
that he is getting into a tractor. He is shouting again. No matter, she will
have crossed the little metal bridge by the time he is even close. It is just ten
metres from her now, thanks to this short-cut. Perhaps he will follow her
up the mountain and hunt her down, like a wild animal. Heh-heh. He can
try.
</p><!--l. 890--><p class="indent" >  She starts up the stoney path, carved through the dense forest, rising sharply
upward in zig-zag up the steep wall of the valley. It reminds her of her childhood trips,
the misery of physical exertion, but the ultimate satisfaction of achievement.
Somehow it seemed worse in her memory.
</p><!--l. 896--><p class="indent" >  Sweat begins to moisten her T-shirt and her breath grows short. This is when one
could wish to be on the Moon. The walking will be good for her though: ﬂat tummy,
ﬁrm backside. It will make some cute boy&#x2019;s day, or night.
</p><!--l. 901--><p class="indent" >  She passes a red “T” symbol painted onto a tree, indicating the tourist route and
feels comforted that she is on the path. It shouldn&#x2019;t be long before she starts to see

some of her babies.
</p><!--l. 905--><p class="indent" >  Down below she can hear the farmer shouting. Is he still shouting at her? Christ,
she thinks, get over it!
</p><!--l. 908--><p class="indent" >  The forest pathway is still mostly dirt, but the slope steepens quickly. She can&#x2019;t text
while walking for much longer. She packs away the little keypad and concentrates on
placing her feet in the right place. Walking up rocky paths is an art of balance. If you
proceed with grace, poise and slow determination, it is a simple matter. If you
scramble around in uncertain movements, you are likely to slip and use up twice the
amount of energy. It is meditative; it requires her attention and prevents her
from doing anything other than completing this singular navigation of the
trail.
</p><!--l. 918--><p class="indent" >  The steady plodding up the hill erases time from her consciousness. She has been
climbing for as long as she can remember and it will last a lifetime yet. It is like being
a graduate student, she thinks. She is enacting a representation of her life. You start on
the path and you have no idea where you are going. Then you end up on a trail that
you are unsure of. It starts slowly then rises sharply and you chug away at it, utterly
mesmerized by the singularity of the task, and completely unaware of how you are
proceeding. Better watch your step or you might be falling before you know
it.
</p><!--l. 928--><p class="indent" >  Her dreaming has tricked her back to an unpleasantness of the past. And here she is,
trying to purge it from her consciousness; trying to render a poison of uncertainty and
doubt neutral with fresh mountain air and aﬃrmative action.
</p><!--l. 933--><p class="indent" >  She is here to take command of the obstacles that plague her. And what does she
do? Only fall right back into the quicksand! <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Jesus, freak, get it together.</span>
</p><!--l. 937--><p class="indent" >  After an indiscernible time, the path seems to dissolve ahead of her, and the trees
scatter as if startled by her arrival. Through the remaining cover, shafts of sunlight ﬁre
aimlessly at the trail. As she emerges into the bright sunlight, she raises her hands as if
to stave oﬀ the sky. The vastness of the void is above her, and down below are rocks
and mud.

</p><!--l. 948--><p class="indent" >  Light rain and a morning chill have summoned forth the tantalizing smell of
eucalyptus. The University of California in San Diego, UCSD has a beautiful
campus, and the walk up the road from the guesthouse is pleasantly shady and
cool, but Den has decided to take a swim in the pool before walking up to
his meeting. It is quiet at the motel guesthouse. Most of the guests are busy
guzzling their breakfast or watching TV in the lounge, so he has the pool to
himself.
</p><!--l. 957--><p class="indent" >  The water is still and clear. He thrusts himself into it, shattering its glassy surface
and replacing it with frothing waves that spill outwards to the edges. He feels bubbles
of air loosening from his body as he cuts through it, ploughing an expanding dovetail
of ripples through the water.
</p><!--l. 963--><p class="indent" >  As he swims, Den runs through the walk up to the campus in his mind. He
dress-rehearsed yesterday; now he tests himself on his mental agility. It will be
important for them to feel that he is sharp and conﬁdent. Den can certainly be
conﬁdent on the surface. He makes a good impression. He still has youthful good
looks and can be charming, in an English sort of way, when he needs to be. He hasn&#x2019;t
come this far without being in command of his faculties. But that kind of discipline
requires constant testing. He likes to use the training time for running through his
list.
</p><!--l. 973--><p class="indent" >  Remember to take charge of the meeting at once. Make sure that you have all the
facts in your head. Marketing is a subtle business and the culture here is quite diﬀerent
from European culture. He should be sure to demonstrate his command of both
worlds. Then there is his other agenda, but not something that can come out. He has to
be convincing.
</p><!--l. 980--><p class="indent" >  Coming to America is always a mixed blessing. The increasing militarization of
the borders makes it harder to move around. So far the anti-terrorism laws
have not made a signiﬁcant impact on tourism and business, but soon it will
be necessary to wear electronic visa inside the country. It seems absurd to

Den. Even prisoners can opt out of wearing their dog tags if they stay in one
place. Tourists will be more accountable. The freedom of movement will
be at a premium, easy in prearranged tours by bus or by plane, but diﬃcult
by car or in solo. He must make the most of the freedoms while they still
survive.
</p><!--l. 991--><p class="indent" >  He will hire – no <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">rent </span>a car.
</p><!--l. 993--><p class="indent" >  Still, the annoyance of a barrage of questions about his intentions make the
whole eﬀort somewhat tiresome. Soon he hopes that his connections with the
top players in the game venture will aﬀord him certain privileges in that
regard.
</p><!--l. 998--><p class="indent" >  He ducks his head down and swims in long broad breast strokes just under the
surface, enjoying the extra thrust and speed it aﬀords him. It charges him with a sense
of power. He feels muscular, larger somehow and in command, isolated in the watery
cocoon from the reality of the surroundings.
</p><!--l. 1004--><p class="indent" >  “Morning, sir. How are you today?”, says a hotel employee who comes around the
corner of the building to his right.
</p><!--l. 1007--><p class="indent" >  “Morning,” his primitive brain responds. He nods back with a smile, enjoying the
pleasantly formal courtesy here in the United States.
</p><!--l. 1010--><p class="indent" >  A couple of young kids hiding behind some erupting fronds peer at him and his
audacious morning display. They giggle and tease him, fully aware that he can see
them. Hide and seek?
</p><!--l. 1014--><p class="indent" >  He suppresses an instinct to join in. Now is not the time to let down his
concentration. Success requires a measure of control, of personal sacriﬁce. No pain,
no gain, darling, <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">nez pah</span>? Whose pain? His or theirs?
</p><!--l. 1019--><p class="indent" >  Ghosts of supposed obligation. Focus, Den. Who are they? Young, middle class,
thin, white. Their eyes are probably blue. She likes horses and he likes the tanks. His
mind skips through a dozen stereotypes that characterize the moment. Always stay on
your toes. Friendship can wait. This moment is about branching out of the box and
becoming something.
</p><!--l. 1026--><p class="indent" >  Den reaches up and lifts himself from the envelope of the pool; he feels the
transitory chill of the warming air seep into his limbs. His hand grabs a towel and rubs
his body lightly down then throws on a robe. The ﬁbres will dry his skin and gently
exorcise the dead skin cells of his outer shell, cleansing his skin as well as his
mood. He dons his pool slippers and ﬂip-ﬂops back to his room, avoiding a
small cleaning device that cringes respectfully into a ball as be approaches
it.
</p><!--l. 1035--><p class="indent" >  Den climbs the short wooden steps, up the outside of the hotel wing to the second
ﬂoor, where his ﬁngerprints grant him access to the suite. The room seems dark and
murky after the brightly lit morning, but the carpet is soft and television lights up as
he enters.
</p><!--l. 1040--><p class="indent" >  There are chairs and tables as well as a bed, even a refrigerator and a kitchen here,
with a breakfast bar, but he will probably not use it. He is not really sure why anyone
would need such a thing. It makes the room seem cold and inappropriate but he

aﬀords it less than a passing thought as he moves directly to the shower. The air is
naturally conditioned for temperature, humidity and scent which is unfamiliar and
rather than relaxing him seems to trigger a disconcerting sense of suspicion. There
must surely be a limit to how invasive environmental controls can be. Certainly the
boundaries are far from what he is used to. He wonders why, in such a beautiful area
with semi-natural fragrances like eucalyptus, they could not simply open the
window and be done with it. Perhaps it would require additional insect control.
Whatever.
</p><!--l. 1054--><p class="indent" >  He slips into the shower and lets the perfect water temperature massage his scalp
and shoulders as the shampoo and conditioner revitalize his jet-lagged hair and the
soap creams his skin. The hotel bathroom products are pleasant, he has to admit and
they perform their duty in removing the eﬀects of the chlorine from the pool.
The hotel chain has probably paid handsomely for their own characteristic
scent.
</p><!--l. 1061--><p class="indent" >  Emerging from the steamy cubicle, he catches sight of the television in
the bedroom. An ad is chiming away. As always, he is both fascinated and
revolted by the advertising culture here. It is his job, but this is so alien to
him.

</p><!--l. 1078--><p class="indent" >  The ad goes on relentlessly bashing away at the product name, but Den kills the
sound as quickly as he can ﬁnd the remote. Good grief, he thinks. It is a far cry from
the ad his company made for the UK market. There they had created a scene
in a caravan home with a middle aged man and woman. The man had bad
breath and ﬁlthy teeth and was reaching for a bag of sweets (candy!). His wife
slaps his hand with a ﬂy swatter and gives him a tube of the new toothpaste,
sending him oﬀ to the bathroom to brush. A week later, he is transformed into a
smiling prince with a perfect smile and his wife admires him with ‘that&#x2019;s better&#x2019;
kind of look. As she turns around, satisﬁed with a job well done, he sees
the bag of sweets still there and the camera zooms in, in slow motion, as
his heart pounds and streaming saliva runs down his teeth like a pastiche of
the classic <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Alien </span>movies. Suddenly a second set of teeth snaps forward and
grabs the sweet bag, swallowing it whole, as his wife simply rolls her eyes. A
voice over concludes: “Icy Fresh – gives you twice the smile of any other

toothpaste.”
</p><!--l. 1095--><p class="indent" >  He cannot help but smile at the memory. It is a far cry from the bombardment
technique used here. But that, after all, is why they need him here. It is his job to
understand these cultural chasms. They separate the continents into cells so
discontinuous that they might have been forged on the very anvil of the ocean ridges
themselves. Without his help their eﬀorts would simply perish in a burial of
subduction. He has been given an opportunity here, like everyone else and he has
come to use it.
</p><!--l. 1104--><p class="indent" >  Den dresses quickly and heads down to breakfast, down the stairs, around around
the short path to the main entrance; past the check-in desk to a dining room full of
what seems to be families and groups of people. He dispatches breakfast
quickly as he sizes up the people sitting here, watching the television in the
corner of the room intently as they shovel down everything from melon to
pancakes.
</p><!--l. 1111--><p class="indent" >  This is all part of the psych up. He has come here for a purpose. He has come to
learn and to impress, to mingle and to climb. The cat is out of the bag for them
now.
</p><!--l. 1115--><p class="indent" >  Someone has tuned the television to CSPAN, a refreshingly naked news
discussion, he thinks, but with so many opportunities missed to convey a message.
It is not long before the hotel management come and change it back to a
diﬀerent news channel, with its rolling text strip and staged presenters. Well,
he has had his moment of peace at the pool, now it is time to rejoin the rat
race.
</p><!--l. 1122--><p class="indent" >  He runs through his list again. He knows it. He can do it. I am here, he thinks. He
eats lightly, still feeling a little sick from the long ﬂight, checks the time and leaves
the breakfast hall, dropping by his room to collect his stuﬀ. Then, released into the
Californian air, he stands at the edge of the ﬂagstone path, looking out to the
awakening freeway. A sign is planted at the side of the path. In the UK it would have
said: PLEASE DO NOT WALK ON THE GRASS. Here it says. ATTENTION:
FLOOR MAY BE SLIPPERY WHEN WET. He stares at it for a few seconds,
realizing where he is.
</p><!--l. 1132--><p class="indent" >  Beating down on the calm forest of palms and bushes, the sun and its cloudless
consort of blue, warm him to the bone. No sign of the chilly morning now. It has
evaporated, like the mist from the pool, winding up in miniature vortices, ﬂedgling
tornadoes. A light breeze is blowing on his legs. Den checks that he has the necessary
items in his portfolio and starts up the embankment from the parking lot of the motel
towards UCSD.

</p><!--l. 1145--><p class="indent" >  The sound of distant water. At ﬁrst, just a dull whisper, like a broken radio, or wind
in the leaves. It grows slowly, gaining deﬁnition with each step. Then around
the corner, the stream is there, erupting on her senses with a clarity, sharp
and angular. Splashing water, tumbling over rocks. She ﬁlls her ﬂask and
drinks.
</p><!--l. 1152--><p class="indent" >  Sara Vibe Stensrud slips oﬀ her backpack for a moment to rest. She is making
slower progress than she anticipated. Her goal is to reach the ﬁrst of the cabins before
evening meal, but she has not been to the gym for some time; aerobic training
has festered into anaerobic misery. But she will make it. She always has her
way.
</p><!--l. 1158--><p class="indent" >  The water rushes past in this little valley outcrop. She is not far from a waterfall.
She stoops to splash some water onto her face. Her cheeks are rosy now; she can feel
the heat in her face. Best not to meet anyone like this. She will coast for a while
once she gets close to the cabin, to cool oﬀ and recover a more becoming
complexion.
</p><!--l. 1165--><p class="indent" >  Her breath billows in the damp air near the stream. This is a fantastic place, wild
and rugged and free from empty restriction. She feels alive here, but it is getting cold.
She needs to keep moving.
</p><!--l. 1170--><p class="indent" >  She checks her distance from the cabin on her wristband, as she loosens the strap. It
seemed like a good idea to wear this handy accessory to keep her hands free and
warm, but she forgets how the sweat builds up underneath the strap making the whole
thing pretty icky. It itches. She takes it oﬀ and examines the soft screen, ﬂattening it
out to get a better image.
</p><!--l. 1177--><p class="indent" >  The map seems to be stuck on a position from some time ago. According to it, she
is not even on the screen. She zooms out, with cold ﬁngers. to see the stream where
she is standing and sees the ‘X&#x2019; that marks her current position. She still has
satellite contact, but mobile cell connectivity is not so good in the dips and
troughs of the landscape. She won&#x2019;t get more detail until she moves into

the open again. So, for now, she will just have to make do with the painted
T&#x2019;s for-tourist, painted on the rocks along the trails. Just like the good old
days.
</p><!--l. 1187--><p class="indent" >  Vibe gets a direction and stuﬀs the wristband into a pocket, hoisting up her
backpack, tightening the belt a little and summoning resolve. Better not rest for
too long; if she sits down and relaxes, she might never get moving again.
Besides, the sun will be going down in about an hour, so she needs to get to the
cabin.
</p><!--l. 1193--><p class="indent" >  She clambers up the boulder scree, away from the stream and towards the greenish,
grassy hills that roll across this plateau top. An edge, an eyeful of the valley oﬀ to the
right: the sinking sun and the thickening cloud. She stops for a moment, remembering
this view from a previous trip. When was it? It seems a long time ago, in a diﬀerent
life. A little splash of nostalgia tears into her present detachment. It is worth
remembering things like that, memories of the past, but only when she is
alone.

</p><!--l. 1203--><p class="noindent" >*</p></div>
<!--l. 1206--><p class="indent" >  She spent many summers here, in the mountains, with Bea and her family, walking
through the mountains, like a troop of Girl Guides. They were the ‘mountain
troupe&#x2019;; not exactly hard core outdoors freaks, but strutting their own stuﬀ,
according to their own script. It was only when she turned sixteen that they came
here together, by themselves, and experienced the freedom that comes from
having one&#x2019;s parents at bay. That was a summer that changed everything for
her.
</p><!--l. 1215--><p class="indent" >  She borrowed a backpack from Bea&#x2019;s brother; he, in turn, dutifully refused to join
the ranks of their essentially female regiment. The pack made her special. It used to
belong to Bea&#x2019;s father. It was covered in sew-on patches and sported dozens of small
tears from its weathered history. She liked the pack. It was solid and real, and had
more character (and certainly more credibility) than the pink vanity cases the other
girls were towing through nature&#x2019;s noble corridor. Bea&#x2019;s younger sister, Nina, looked
up at her tall form with awe and admiration, through freckles and eyelashes. Her
hair was spiky, mostly on top, like an exploding fountain of red. “You&#x2019;re so
beautiful, Sara,” she said. Somehow, the thought had never occurred to her
before. With the lead backpack, she felt a new importance, like a leader of the
pack.
</p><!--l. 1228--><p class="indent" >  Bea was cooler than all the others she knew. Sara always thought so. There was,
after all, a reason they became best friends. When other girls were conspicuously
going to parties, openly pretending to enjoy alcohol and boys (while hiding their pony
magazines under their single beds), Sara and Bea were climbing trees and hanging out

with boys because they were cool and because they weren&#x2019;t so goddamn
self-absorbed and bitchy. They both had brace retainers on their teeth back
then. They felt like two fanged wolves, scurrying around in the wild. Other
than their friendship, they had little in common. Perhaps that was part of
it.
</p><!--l. 1239--><p class="indent" >  Sara was never much impressed by the boys of her age, but she knew she was
attractive to them. They would whistle at her with that vulgar barbarism that boys
feigned, or perhaps it was even real, but it did nothing for her. She had a mild crush on
her math teacher, until he seriously dummed out by telling them that the reason hair
waves were called ‘perms&#x2019; came from the mathematical term ‘permutation&#x2019;. Duh,
please.
</p><!--l. 1247--><p class="indent" >  The boys of her own age were mostly clueless and clumsy, but there was one who
was quiet and smart and good looking. He was a loner, though: shy and deep
looking. She liked that, but he was way too introverted for her then. Not to
be.
</p><!--l. 1252--><p class="indent" >  She went to a special school in those days. A school that was supposed to teach
old-fashioned academic values, Dad&#x2019;s idea. He wanted her to grow up smart, not like
the regular idiot savants that schools pump out, he said. Not many boys to choose
from.
</p><!--l. 1257--><p class="indent" >  Sara did not really ﬁnd her natural connection with boys until that summer.
After her trip to the mountains, her father invited some French and American
scientists home. Peter Green. The handsome one. He was young and dark. He
had an intensity that she found magnetic and when he looked at her, she
felt like jelly. She ﬂirted with him openly. She was riding on the crest of
a boosted self-image, having been troop queen for the younger sisters and
Bea.
</p><!--l. 1267--><p class="indent" >  There was a party one night, just before they were about to leave, and she made
sure that she was close to him. She wore a short white skirt to show oﬀ her long legs
and a white sleeveless T-shirt that showed her belly button and small breasts. White
sports shoes. She was purity. She left her hair long, not tied back, just pushed behind
her ears. She practised a smoldering look.
</p><!--l. 1274--><p class="indent" >  The scientists were seated in a group of chairs and sofas in the crowded living
room. There were all kinds of people from the University and people she had never
seen before. She made certain that she was next to him, on the arm of the sofa and told
him that she wanted to practice her English. When they were ﬁnished talking,
she stood there, in the tightly packed room, next to him, so that her leg was
next to his arm. She listened to him speak. He was calm, a bit forceful. He
did not ignore her, even though he was talking to others. She felt important,
sexy.
</p><!--l. 1284--><p class="indent" >  At ﬁrst he put his hand on the back of her leg playfully, taking it away
again, causally, not too forward, as he waved his hands in explanation. But she
knew what he was thinking. Then, as she responded by bumping causally
towards him and brushing him with her body, she started. His hand touched the

inside of her thighs from behind, just gently with ﬁngers brushing her at ﬁrst.
In the cover of the crowd, no one else could see; it gradually crept higher,
testing her resolve, until his index ﬁnger just touched her panties in the rift
between her legs and his thumb stroked the crease of her buttocks. He kept his
hand there for several seconds. Her breathing became heavy but she forced
herself to maintain her outward appearance as though nothing unusual was
afoot. Even years later, the excitement she felt still paralyses her with its
intensity. Such audacity, such a thrill of excitement from someone so safe.
Finally, he removed his hand and she put her hand on his shoulder to steady
herself, and then ﬂed to a place where she could sit alone for a while and touch
the spot where his hand had been. The next time she saw him, they both
smiled coyly, but nothing more was said of it, and then he was gone. Peter
Green.
</p><!--l. 1304--><p class="indent" >  It has always been hard to describe the sense of freedom she felt after that, to justify
it and understand it, yet it altered her somehow. Sara has always been a loose canon,
impulsive and unapologetic. That summer, she became freer, she became
Vibe.
</p><!--l. 1309--><p class="indent" >  Both Sara and Vibe always had their way. Her father always gave in to her, in spite
of her mother&#x2019;s protests. Unlike many of her girlfriends, she felt an almost boyish
passion for life. He let her be herself. She was never contented to simply coast along
in the passenger seat, or wait for fortune to come to her. She always wanted to take the
rudder and sail into stormy waters, to ﬁnd the nexus, the place where something is
happening. To hell with passive girl friends, waiting for life to show them what to
do.
</p><!--l. 1318--><p class="indent" >  Something about her encounter that summer fostered the realization that she could
be independent and that it was not only her father who would accede to her
wishes. But then her father died suddenly of a heart condition, not long after
the visit. He was still young, in his ﬁfties, but there was some congenital
weakness. She contained her emotions well in public, but she was devastated. She
resolved to honour his trust in her by making the most of her life. Her only
regret was that Bea could not join her on her quest. She was not the school
kind. But she was still the only one who would keep her company during her
struggle.
</p><!--l. 1329--><p class="indent" >  By the time that summer was over, she knew that there was no turning back. She
was committed to a diﬀerent path. The forces of destiny would steer her
away from her remaining family, to a future that no one had considered for
her.
</p><!--l. 1334--><p class="indent" >  Vibe focused on her studies, enjoying boys like a commodity, only when it
suited her. She studied for three years at Oslo University College, learning
programming and system design. She pursued her own interests, seeking a path
of her own rather than following on her father&#x2019;s footsteps, or her mother&#x2019;s.
Her mother set her straight on that, when she occasionally doubted her own
judgement. She enjoyed mathematics and chemistry, but felt she needed to

understand the all-pervasive tools of computing and communications. They are all
around.
</p><!--l. 1343--><p class="indent" >  By the end of her degree, she felt as though she had transformed her view of the
world, but she was weary of machines and their virtual worlds and felt that there must
be more that she could apply her skills to. Computer science seemed like an empty
shell: a skill to build things, but without a vision of what to build. She enrolled in
courses of linguistics, mathematics and in environmental engineering to bide her time
while she considered her options. She joined Bellona and learned how to enjoy the
environment in a responsible way. She joined Bea and her family more often after
that, walking in the mountains from cabin to cabin. It was a good way to keep in
touch with her friend and to get out into the environment. Bea became a
hairdresser.
</p><!--l. 1356--><p class="indent" >  Ultimately, it was a professor at the College working in the management of
computer systems who convinced her that she could combine all her talents by
applying technology to better the environment. She enrolled in a Ph.D. programme
with the project of a lifetime, a project to make everyone envious: the testing and
development of commercial applications of planetary robotic technology in mountain
tourism and maintenance.
</p><!--l. 1364--><p class="indent" >  It seemed like an odd thing to do, developing little robots to wander around the
Norwegian mountains, but where better to test such technologies than in a place where
there is both highly variable terrain and suﬃcient human infrastructure to keep tabs on
them. They could be put to work for the tourist board, maintaining and monitoring,
helping mountain rescue.
</p><!--l. 1371--><p class="indent" >  At ﬁrst the challenge had seemed almost too enormous to grasp, but she
dismissed her fears and overrode them with a leap of faith. I can do it if I want
to, she thought. Besides, who else could appreciate this unique mixture of
skills as well as I can? It was not a case of talking her into it. It was just
perfect.
</p><!--l. 1377--><p class="indent" >  Her college professor shrugged it oﬀ, joking: if you want to reach for the stars, you
should build a rocket rather than waiting for the sky to fall on your head.
So, standing on this very spot, two years ago, she decided to reach for the
stars.

mean a change of fortune; changing winds often mean precipitation is on the way. It
could be snowing within the hour.
</p><!--l. 1395--><p class="indent" >  Vibe reaches the barely perceptible summit of an asymptotic climb, ﬂouting Zeno

and his stupid paradox to reach the top. It seems to have taken her hours
to conquer this minor bump, winding upward through mud and stones, but
she is careful not to pay attention to time. A watched kettle never makes the
top.
</p><!--l. 1401--><p class="indent" >  Down below, in shadow, she sees a thin strip of a ﬂag ﬂapping in the chilly breeze,
and the warm lights of the cabin she has been aiming for, with its grassy roof and
dormitories. Her mobile signal has been strong for some time now and she has
already checked in. They should be expecting her. She ﬂashes her new ETA
to reserve dinner. She should make it to the ﬁrst sitting, in spite of being
late. Oddly, she has not received any reply from the French team. Where are
you?
</p><!--l. 1409--><p class="indent" >  No cinder of daylight remains now. She is following the trail by fortuitous
moonlight. She sets oﬀ down the hill at a faster pace.
</p><!--l. 1412--><p class="indent" >  It doesn&#x2019;t take long. The stone steps leading to the cabin are a little too steep to run
up, but Vibe feels an exuberant lightness of step as she reaches her goal. This is it.
She&#x2019;s arrived. Soon it will be down to work, and . . . well, one thing at a
time.
</p><!--l. 1417--><p class="indent" >  She approves of the cabin, with the exception of a rank smell of overﬂowed sewage.
The entrance is less kitschy than many of the other cabins she has been to. There are
no overbearing wood-carvings or fake runes to greet her, no models of trolls for the
tourists, just a simple sign saying “Reception this way”. In the Norwegian way it
says “Eksepedisjon” or place of expedition. A ﬁtting double entendre for the
traveller.
</p><!--l. 1425--><p class="indent" >  It is close to dinner time. The benches where people are supposed to take oﬀ or put
on their boots are empty and there is a buzz of conversation coming from inside. It is a
strangely comforting sound after a day of isolation. She arrives at the cabin lodge to
meet the team.

ahead.”
</p><!--l. 1438--><p class="indent" >  The man at the reception taps away at a touch screen and scans Vibe&#x2019;s
mobile.
</p><!--l. 1441--><p class="indent" >  “You know that you shouldn&#x2019;t be walking around up here alone now? We are on
alert up here.”
</p><!--l. 1444--><p class="indent" >  She nods. “I know. They told me down below. I have business up here.”
</p><!--l. 1446--><p class="indent" >  “Well, you&#x2019;re here now.”
</p><!--l. 1448--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah.”

</p><!--l. 1453--><p class="indent" >  “Better make it a single tonight,” she says. It occurs to her that her mobile has
already reported her position to the police and rescue service.

</p><!--l. 1459--><p class="indent" >  “I am supposed to be meeting a group of French scientists here tonight. Do you
know where they are? At dinner, perhaps?”
</p><!--l. 1462--><p class="indent" >  He looks back at her with wide eyes that she is unable to fathom. There is no
show of emotion in them, nor is there any sign that he has comprehended
her question. He seems to have expedited her and there is nothing more to
say.
</p><!--l. 1467--><p class="indent" >  “French? A group of them? I guess I&#x2019;ll ﬁnd them here somewhere.”
</p><!--l. 1469--><p class="indent" >  She searches his face for some sign—some trace of understanding, or,
indeed, of anything. She ﬁnds it dead, devoid of content, as if all of his facial
muscles have died in some fatal brain crash. He is disinterested; he is merely
dis.
</p><!--l. 1474--><p class="indent" >  She goes out into the darkening evening and looks around at the shadowy mountain
scenery. Her room is across in the next cabin outhouse. In the dark, the ground
between the cabin and the VeiVek at the base of the valley seems like an explosion of
rubble, as though the aftermath of some great catastrophe. Deﬁant tree-sentinels line
the forest edge, as if forming a quasi-human shield against the explosion. The
boulders bear their granite teeth, smashed by some gigantic blow to the mouth of the
rock.
</p><!--l. 1483--><p class="indent" >  This is the night from which she emerged only moments ago, yet already it
seems hostile and alien. She is glad to ﬁnally be here in the shelter of the
cabin.
</p><!--l. 1487--><p class="indent" >  An old fashioned key turns a lock. A door creaks open. A wooden bed with a
simple douvé and pillow and a sink. Vibe sets down her backpack and sits down to
take oﬀ her walking boots to swap for something more suitable for indoor
use.
</p><!--l. 1492--><p class="indent" >  I can&#x2019;t stay here in a single room for long, she thinks. Not unless I can get some
funding for this trip.
</p><!--l. 1495--><p class="indent" >  She checks for voice messages on her mobile. Nothing, Jonas Lindgren, her
secondary advisor, now at the Research Council. Where are you Jonas? Where is my
money? She tried contacting him before leaving and again on the train, but he is not
answering.
</p><!--l. 1500--><p class="indent" >  She opens her pack, pulls out shoes and fresh clothes and washes up for dinner. She
texts a quick message to the leader of the French group, Mrs. Laurent, but receives no
reply. The French team has been out here testing the research and environmental
monitoring capabilities of the VeiVeks. They promised to meet her to show her
the ropes and go through some of the procedures in the ﬁeld. So why no
answer?
</p><!--l. 1508--><p class="indent" >  They are not even here.
</p><!--l. 1510--><p class="indent" >  She feels like an idiot and reels oﬀ a string of cuss words to pollute the environment

a little more. Sorry, plants. Does anyone give a crap how much eﬀort to took her to get
here?
</p><!--l. 1514--><p class="indent" >  No answer. But she&#x2019;d better go and check.
</p><!--l. 1516--><p class="indent" >  Vibe feels as if she has somehow been catapulted light years from home. What is
the point of a mobile if you can&#x2019;t get what you want when you want it? The rugged
wilderness has seldom seemed so inhospitable as now. She resolves to lift her spirits
with a little company.

</p><!--l. 1532--><p class="indent" >  So the international newspapers say. The story has been leaked. The penny has
dropped, the cat has scatted. Talk show hosts are mentioning it, conspiracy theorists
are discussing it in private channels and even within the game itself. But
here, in the US, no one is even wrinkling their whiskers. Virtual Reality –
VR.
</p><!--l. 1538--><p class="indent" >  <span

</p><!--l. 1541--><p class="indent" >  The game. Is it a fad? Is it good or bad? It is the VR scenic programmable
chat-room, cat-room. And none should be the wiser about what has transpired beneath
the surface. Users can meet, interact and play games with each other. They can win
points by being good to each, or by killing the enemies of society. But what is it in
reality?
</p><!--l. 1547--><p class="indent" >  <span

They go there to be diﬀerent or to be the same; they face their fears or they hide their

</p><!--l. 1553--><p class="indent" >  But not every game is a game. Words and phrases are not always chosen to describe
the truth of the matter. A veil of imagery can be designed to camouﬂage rather than to
reveal; intention clouded in diversion; plain surfaces adorned with graﬃti and slogans
that delude the onlooker. Some see what they want to see. If playfulness is the art of

</p><!--l. 1563--><p class="indent" >  Delegates and conference attendees have gathered in the air conditioned melting
pot of the public conference centre, centred on the larger auditoria in the UCSD
campus. They are queueing up to register for this public event, the unveiling of the
mystery cat. Carefully cooled, scrubbed and ionized air is tense with expectation

following the alleged revelations about the unscrupulous intentions of the
game. Almost everyone here has been involved in making it, but still there
fosters a doubt in the backs of their minds. No one is stupid, but how far
might they have been duped? Consider the embarrassment, the breach of
trust.
</p><!--l. 1574--><p class="indent" >  Decades have been invested in the technology of computer games, to reach
the sophistication that can be called a virtual reality. Distributed code and
processing, on a public Internet, has made a new generation of interactive
meeting places possible. Now they are here. Rejoice the advertisers, rejoice the
governments.
</p><!--l. 1580--><p class="indent" >  At ﬁrst, they imagined a complex web of scenarios, built into ever more
programmed entertainments, but as always, it is the simplest ideas that are the best.
From instant messaging to chat rooms and virtual realms to immersive games, the
progression has captured the widest possible audience, using any and every language,
interfaced by a nexus of universal communication and trust. The technology to reach
into minds, young and old, wanting or lonely; it is embraced by anyone and everyone
needing a lifeline to a wider community, or seeking a release from the stress of
proximity..
</p><!--l. 1590--><p class="indent" >  Not only do personal mobiles allow players to enter the game from wherever they
might be, they equip every person with their own social body armour. No one needs to
meet anyone, no one needs to risk anything in an encounter. They are safe and
deluded. They ﬁlter out anything they do not want to see. The quiet, the reserved and
the shy are the winners and the losers in this game. The game allows them
to be whomever they want to be. But in the end, the illusion of contact is
the only contact they have with others. No more having to confront their
fears.
</p><!--l. 1600--><p class="indent" >  <span

traditional action gaming companies funding the creation of a fully blown experiment
to link home computers into a common generated environment. Open, free software.
Al the world can join in. An amalgamation of popular and enticing meeting
places. Virtual environments and businesses reaching out to the wider world of
possibility.
</p><!--l. 1612--><p class="indent" >  There is a new economy to be won from trivial pursuits. Sponsorship alone for
advertising, in this new space, is generating new markets and new opportunities.
Given such as soap box, there are few voices who would not like to be heard.

</p><!--l. 1621--><p class="indent" >  Few have not been seduced by the idea of a controlling share in this adventure. Den
and his company have been given the rights to develop message broadcasting
technologies. It is a huge privilege, a considerable status, but there will be no resting

on laurels here. The world of advertising and marketing is cut-throat and humans do
not have nine lives.
</p><!--l. 1628--><p class="indent" >  Even from the start, Den realized that the possibilities were breathtaking and his
head-start has been a fortuitous advantage in the arena. They have known for years
that games would be a new dimension for marketing: every object, every
movement, every colour or attribute of a virtual world is a potential icon for
something. The skillful orchestrator of those attributes can make subliminal
connections that will plant names, products, perhaps even attitudes in receptive
minds.
</p><!--l. 1636--><p class="indent" >  Of course it is a tricky business. Too much, and they will simply shut down.
Sometimes even Den feels the need to close his mind even to the simplest, most
primitive advertising imagery, posted on the trains and tunnels of the London
Underground. The barrage of messages and imagery can be overwhelming. Little
catch phrases from posters go around and around in his head, driving him crazy. Now
imagine the possibilities in a virtual world. Total immersion and total control
over the environment. Imagine how total immersion could be used to direct
thought.
</p><!--l. 1647--><p class="indent" >  China has complained to the U.S: government about the excessive freedom of
access to the game. They have imposed strict ﬁltering policies on the content, but not
even they can be sure that they have ﬁltered every subtle message.
</p><!--l. 1652--><p class="indent" >  Norway, a gaming nation proud of its cultural heritage, was early in wanting to
inject national cultural values into the scenery, so that generations of Norwegians
would not grow up learning only Hollywood fabricated culture.
</p><!--l. 1657--><p class="indent" >  Other nations have followed suit. So far, activist lobbies have not argued seriously
for regulation of access to virtual realms. The game, after all, is very carefully
designed to allow people to see almost exactly what they want to see. How could it
possibly oﬀend? But it has set everyone thinking.
</p><!--l. 1663--><p class="indent" >  When all this came together and exploded into the world in a cosmogony of
network reinvention, it was a force that could not be stopped. Corporate wishes and
multimedia fantasies attracted each other like the explosive matter of a stellar nursery,
falling gradually in on itself and igniting with the mesmerizing blaze of future
proﬁts.

mingle. He knows a few faces from his personal involvement over the last
few years, but there are many newcomers. It will not be easy to ﬁnd anyone
here during this public event. It will be the private meetings that count the
most.
</p><!--l. 1688--><p class="indent" >  After he has given a speech on the benign involvement of the international

he really buy it himself? Who is he kidding?
</p><!--l. 1700--><p class="indent" >  Listening to the eager eﬀervescence of American accents around him, he feels like
an outsider. The involvement of foreign contractors was always controversial to
the game executive, but advisors and sub-contractors have been engaged to
work on it from the start. Naturally, each company or individual was made to
sign a contract of absolute secrecy. Some kind of deal was done with patents
that Den could not understand, To him it barely seemed legal, but he is no
expert.
</p><!--l. 1709--><p class="indent" >  They needed help. Even a U.S. led collaboration could not solve all of the problems
internally. Cheap labour from the Far East, to create the code base quickly; advisors
from Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia were engaged to design scenery
and advertising styles, as well as to decide on the boundaries for allowed
behaviour—what users logged on from diﬀerent regions would be allowed to see and
do.

</p><!--l. 1719--><p class="indent" >  One government senator is reputed to have complained: “Can we allow these
outsiders into the project?”
</p><!--l. 1722--><p class="indent" >  “Senator,” his counterpart rebuked, “without these outsiders we would
not have the technology at all. We need to speak their language at the very
least.”
</p><!--l. 1726--><p class="indent" >  Later he was to be shrouded in scandal for the allegation that the next major threat
against America was to come from the European Community rather than Russia or
China. We have given too much away! Time to take it back. Forget about Mao&#x2019;s little
red book, focus on the NSA&#x2019;s Red Book. Unfortunately that would be a signiﬁcant
loss of revenue for the U.S, and money talks in Washington. The senator was
eventually silenced but not before it had been reported in the Herald Tribune and the
story broadcast.
</p><!--l. 1735--><p class="indent" >  Then the dam broke. A month ago, a story was leaked to the press from an
unknown source, claiming that the game was really a ploy by the U.S. government to

extend its public diplomacy engine, so as to reach out to children all over the world
and show falsely romantic ideals of the American Dream with the help of the
game.

users. Voices have claimed that it is to be used as a form of espionage, for
information collection, but the proof? So far no one has managed to prove it. Surely,
with so many experts watching, it would not be possible to pull such a fast
one.
</p><!--l. 1753--><p class="indent" >  Peace activists argue that, by providing agency-sponsored war games for kids at
home, the game designers could keep Americans and their allies attuned to the idea of
violent intervention, paving the acceptance for future military interventions when
necessary. By making the use of weapons a natural part of everyday life, the game
designers could render the anti-gun lobby irrelevant and fanatical in the eyes of

how marketing opportunities will be managed within the game. Is he doing their
bidding, or serving his own agenda?
</p><!--l. 1777--><p class="indent" >  After all, the game is the very paw print of Western capitalism. His company alone
won the right to develop the technologies for advertising in VR. The challenge is to
avoid the mistakes of the past: information overload. In VR there are more
opportunities to tie directed appeals into individuals&#x2019; preferences, in an intelligent and

</p><!--l. 1791--><p class="indent" >  “It is all about information.”
</p><!--l. 1793--><p class="indent" >  “Well,” Den replies coolly, “the game allows users to ﬁlter out things they don&#x2019;t
want to see, so in that sense this is a space in which their interests are better protected
than ever before.”
</p><!--l. 1797--><p class="indent" >  “Doesn&#x2019;t that assume that they know how to do it?”

</p><!--l. 1810--><p class="indent" >  Someone breaks in. “I think it is important to remember that this is a commercial
venture, not a charity program. Someone has to pay for this, and we want the
technology to pay for itself.”
</p><!--l. 1814--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, yes, but in the process we are giving the world a whole new technology to
communicate with – with built-in universal translation! Never before has an African
tribesman been able to communicate with a broker on the Hong Kong stock exchange,
without an interloper, and in an environment of their mutual choosing. The
possibilities for diplomacy alone are enormous.”

Working with the FBI, Europol investigators have foreseen both the dangers of a

maﬁa organizations and child pornography rings from around the world. We are well
aware of the possibilities.”
</p><!--l. 1847--><p class="indent" >  “Mr. Morris, research into virtual realities and business spaces has been the
oﬃcial line on the game, and users have been quick to play the demonstration
scenarios, like ﬁghting in the U.S. Marines in Afghanistan and Iraq, joining the
International Space Station and a range of favourite movie scenarios. It is not
natural that America should be a scapegoat for every paranoid conspiracy now?
After all, only the Americans have had the industrial might to initiate the

game, and the environment of freedom to develop it. We are the maker of
dreams.“
</p><!--l. 1856--><p class="indent" >  “If there is a conspiracy, it is that now everyone would like to hijack this great
invention for their own purpose. The game executive issued a press release saying
that, if there is any control or inﬂuence over behaviour in the game, it was made to
instill moral values into a potentially unethical technology. These values should be
sound American values of freedom, opportunity and morality. By oﬀering a voice of
hope and freedom the world over there must be positive repercussions. Fewer
kids will turn to terrorism against the Western allies if they can see another
way.”
</p><!--l. 1867--><p class="indent" >  “Of course, they fail to mention that multinational corporations have no ethics.
They will deal with the devil himself if they can make a proﬁt.”
</p><!--l. 1870--><p class="indent" >  “Well, we don&#x2019;t call it corruption when it&#x2019;s business.”
</p><!--l. 1872--><p class="indent" >  “Powerful evangelists from the Bible belt made their bid but the matter was never
spoken about again.”
</p><!--l. 1875--><p class="indent" >  “In America, we have a constitutional separation of church and state, but we cannot
keep religion out of peoples&#x2019; lives!”
</p><!--l. 1878--><p class="indent" >  “Halley, an opposition member in the house, had promised a public debate on the
ethics of the game. He was due to give his speech last year, but was shot and killed in
his car by a gang in Washington D.C. - murder capital of the U.S. Do you have any
comment on that?”
</p><!--l. 1883--><p class="indent" >  The cat seems to have escaped its bag.
</p><!--l. 1885--><p class="indent" >  <span

<!--l. 1892--><p class="indent" >  As the meeting scatters into fragments of puzzlement and only partially abated
concern, he feels calmly conﬁdent that he played his part well. His position in this
assembly is now reinforced and cleansed of its tainting graﬃti, as if he has been
purged of witchery, or an unsightly stain on his suit has been skillfully erased by his
silver tongue. One down and one to go. Den has arranged to talk to one of the
researchers from the Supercomputing Center&#x2019;s Crime Analysis Team. She has asked
to see him, specially.
</p><!--l. 1901--><p class="indent" >  The walk through the UCSD campus is like visiting a tropical garden or zoo. It&#x2019;s a
far cry from the drizzle of London. The thought of focusing on his job does not hold
much appeal here.
</p><!--l. 1905--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">We should have held this meeting in London</span>, he thinks. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">How do people work here</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">anyway?</span>
</p><!--l. 1908--><p class="indent" >  He reaches the sculpted oasis of shops and cafes. Lunch tables are lined up
outdoors. Reddish green leaves hang from the spindly trees. He does not know what

kind they are. The bustling of students and students hunched over fast food in this
little crafted amphitheatre They call to each other, chasing and ﬂirting. He glances
over at the UCSD book-shop. There is someone coming out. College kids, tossing
around like imbeciles.
</p><!--l. 1916--><p class="indent" >  “Lord Jesus Christ ﬁll your heart,” someone says, distracting him.
</p><!--l. 1918--><p class="indent" >  His mobile beeps. There is a message waiting for him from his virtual sister. She is
his eyes and ears in the VR, but there&#x2019;s no time for that now. He defers the message
until later. Need to concentrate now. A meeting has been arranged. He is
intrigued.
</p><!--l. 1923--><p class="indent" >  A slim Asian-looking woman steps out of the bookstore. There is something about
her that attracts his attention. His trained eye can see something undeﬁnable about her
that is not attuned to the surroundings. She is as foreign to this place as he is. She
returns his glance, raising an eyebrow. As she approaches, he sees that her face is
youthful but has a distinctive gravitas. It gives her an oddly attractive quality
that is both old and young at the same time, concealing perhaps some deep
secret behind a veneer of youthful charm. He has no idea how old she might
be.
</p><!--l. 1933--><p class="indent" >  He ﬁnds himself intrigued and immediately speculates about her. Rise as she
approaches, to take a better look. They shake hands, a little too warmly for a ﬁrst
meeting. Her blouse is open slightly, revealing the beginning of the curve of
her skin. Her smart, tightly ﬁtting skirt makes light work for the rest of his
imagination.
</p><!--l. 1939--><p class="indent" >  Her eyes are friends: they exude a feeling of recognition, as though he has just
taken a look into her soul and emerged unscathed. She is a friend, but he is not sure
how or why he knows. He is dazed slightly at this momentary immersion and has to
pull himself back to the present. This is his weakness. He has always been a bit of a
player, but never really in command.
</p><!--l. 1946--><p class="indent" >  “I am Den Morris,” he says.
</p><!--l. 1948--><p class="indent" >  “Cathy Kim,” she replies. She ﬂashes him a ﬂirtatious smile.
</p><!--l. 1950--><p class="indent" >  He looks around, expecting a larger group. “Is it just you?”
</p><!--l. 1952--><p class="indent" >  She nods. “You want a sub?” She fumbles in a shoulder bag for something
paper-wrapped.
</p><!--l. 1955--><p class="indent" >  “A sub?”
</p><!--l. 1957--><p class="indent" >  “A submarine?”
</p><!--l. 1959--><p class="indent" >  She takes out a baguette wrapped in paper and he recalls that sub is a nickname for
these long sandwiches. He laughs at the thought of someone carrying a submarine in
their shoulder bag. Is it nuclear? “Well a whole sub is probably too much. Maybe just
a small bathysphere. . .”
</p><!--l. 1965--><p class="indent" >  “Excuse me?”
</p><!--l. 1967--><p class="indent" >  “Never mind.”
</p><!--l. 1969--><p class="indent" >  “You&#x2019;re good?”
</p><!--l. 1971--><p class="indent" >  “No. I&#x2019;ll take one.”
</p><!--l. 1973--><p class="indent" >  She looks confused but smiles and hands him one of the oversized packages

anyway. “Why don&#x2019;t we walk and talk, it&#x2019;s going to get pretty crowded here any
minute.”
</p><!--l. 1977--><p class="indent" >  He nods. “Lunch break for the students?”
</p><!--l. 1979--><p class="indent" >  “Exactly. Follow me.”
</p><!--l. 1981--><p class="indent" >  She walks up the steps of the amphitheatre in front of him, giving him a prime view
of her tight rear end as she shuﬄes up the steps. She is pretty hot, Den thinks. And she
knows it.
</p><!--l. 1985--><p class="indent" >  Cathy Kim is not what he expected a computer researcher to look like. Somehow he
expected to see black jeans and a tent of a T-shirt, sneakers and greasy hair. Either
she is not really a researcher, she is administration or she is married. All
of these things might be true, but the thing that keeps his attention, apart
from her ‘butt&#x2019; is that she has an air of successful wealth about her. That
means that this is a serious enquiry and there might be something in it for
him.
</p><!--l. 1993--><p class="indent" >  They emerge from the amphitheatre onto a garden path that seems to run through
the campus. “Let&#x2019;s go right”, she says.
</p><!--l. 1996--><p class="indent" >  Den nods. “Ok. So you know, I&#x2019;m intrigued.”
</p><!--l. 1998--><p class="indent" >  She looks at him as they stroll. “Why I asked you to meet me?”
</p><!--l. 2000--><p class="indent" >  “Yes.”
</p><!--l. 2002--><p class="indent" >  “I heard your talk today. It was good. You gave a good presentation.”
</p><!--l. 2004--><p class="indent" >  “Thanks.”
</p><!--l. 2006--><p class="indent" >  “You&#x2019;d think that a marketing viewpoint would not be all that interesting to the
research division of the game, wouldn&#x2019;t you? But actually, what you said was very
interesting to me.”
</p><!--l. 2010--><p class="indent" >  “What do you do?” he ﬁshes, looking down on her. She is petite. Under her blouse
he imagines a soft but ribby torso with tiny breasts. She is attractive.
</p><!--l. 2014--><p class="indent" >  “Well,” she says. “Good question. I work on the ﬂow security, of the social
networks.”
</p><!--l. 2017--><p class="indent" >  Den looks at her gormlessly. “Flow security of social networks. Social ﬂow. What is
that?”
</p><!--l. 2020--><p class="indent" >  For a moment she looks back calmly. “Well it&#x2019;s about channels of inﬂuence really.
The game is this huge social network. In any network there are hundreds of channels
of communication. All of the players can – at least in principle – send messages to
anyone else. That allows them to generate implicit content that could be used to
spread hidden messages, or simply to alter behaviour. To herd to people about. . .you
know.”
</p><!--l. 2028--><p class="indent" >  “What kinds of messages?”
</p><!--l. 2030--><p class="indent" >  “Well—your kind.”
</p><!--l. 2032--><p class="indent" >  “My kind?”
</p><!--l. 2034--><p class="indent" >  “Like marketing. You deal in directed messaging.”
</p><!--l. 2036--><p class="indent" >  “Right,” he trails. “I must be tired. Jet lag.”
</p><!--l. 2038--><p class="indent" >  “Would you rather put this oﬀ?”
</p><!--l. 2040--><p class="indent" >  “No, no. Go ahead. Sorry.”

</p><!--l. 2042--><p class="indent" >  She smiles. “Well anyone could start their own advertising, mass messaging or soap
box preaching, so there has to be some kind of security system that is looking for
these intrusions. We call it intrusion detection.”
</p><!--l. 2047--><p class="indent" >  “Intrusion detection?”
</p><!--l. 2049--><p class="indent" >  She cocks her head. “Yeah—it&#x2019;s a long story. Historical reasons.”
</p><!--l. 2051--><p class="indent" >  “And you work on this detection?”
</p><!--l. 2053--><p class="indent" >  “Sort of. It&#x2019;s a fully automatic system that is supposed to detect and stop obvious
attempts at illegal message transmission. I just do research on the mechanisms. There
are access lists, permission and all the usual kinds of security authorizations
that decide who is allowed to do what. My interest is in the actual pattern
identiﬁcation.”
</p><!--l. 2059--><p class="indent" >  “So, now that the press has caught wind of this conspiracy story, some would say
that your system is more important than ever.”
</p><!--l. 2062--><p class="indent" >  “Exactly. There is certainly a lot of interest in it from high up. At the same time,
there is pressure from our sponsors to not completely eliminate the possibility for
mass suggestion!” She sends a knowing look.
</p><!--l. 2066--><p class="indent" >  He nods, interested, but not sure where this is going. “Who are we talking
about?”
</p><!--l. 2068--><p class="indent" >  “Where do we begin? All of the usual peddlers of ﬁlth: companies, governments. .
.you know” She laughs. “The Christian and Jewish lobbies are never far away, and the
soft drink companies have been looking at it. And, of course, the largest marketing
companies for major corporations. Then there are government bodies. . .should I go
on?”
</p><!--l. 2075--><p class="indent" >  “So the stories of government involvement are not so far from the truth.”
</p><!--l. 2078--><p class="indent" >  “Certainly, the U.S. government is involved. They have subsidised the American
interest in this game to ensure our lead. That is just par for the course. He who
controls the ﬂow of messages in the game is powerful indeed. You can only imagine
how many people want in.”
</p><!--l. 2083--><p class="indent" >  “I can certainly imagine, but . . .”
</p><!--l. 2085--><p class="indent" >  “But why am I bothering you with all this?”
</p><!--l. 2087--><p class="indent" >  He chuckles. “I was going to put it more subtly, but that&#x2019;s about it, yes.”
</p><!--l. 2089--><p class="indent" >  She examines him through the corner of her eye with a serious intensity, but smiles
as if the transmit a dampening signal to disarm him.
</p><!--l. 2093--><p class="indent" >  “I am interested in your methods.”
</p><!--l. 2095--><p class="indent" >  “How we identify interest groups for marketing?”
</p><!--l. 2097--><p class="indent" >  She grins. “Exactly. I am guessing that our jobs are not all that diﬀerent. I was
hoping we could discuss methods and perhaps come up with some kind of
collaboration.”
</p><!--l. 2101--><p class="indent" >  “Heheh—I would love to just say yes, but I know we have some technologies based
on search engine methodology that is proprietary. I can&#x2019;t just say yes, not without
running it past our board.”
</p><!--l. 2105--><p class="indent" >  “I understand that. But we could talk informally, and perhaps talk about what
we could do with such a collaboration. My work is sponsored by several

groups, but that doesn&#x2019;t grant me any particular access to the actual data of the
game.”
</p><!--l. 2110--><p class="indent" >  “All right.”
</p><!--l. 2112--><p class="indent" >  “Some of our research is for the F.B.I. and Interpol. They have an interest in the
game from several perspectives. The point is that we need access to information about
what is going on in the game from other parts of the world too, from several diﬀerent
angles. Here in the U.S. law enforcement has access to anything it wants, but abroad
there is only limited data to go on. ”
</p><!--l. 2119--><p class="indent" >  “You&#x2019;re after intelligence? I don&#x2019;t think our data would be useful for that.”
</p><!--l. 2121--><p class="indent" >  “Well, we&#x2019;re after data. We are trying, amongst other things, to verify some claims
that a group in Spain has put forward. It could be an important discovery that has
security implications. I don&#x2019;t know, of course, but I am guessing that your company&#x2019;s
unique mixture of marketing and analysis will allow me to see movements in the game
by special interest groups.
</p><!--l. 2127--><p class="indent" >  “We need to be able to compare the patterns of usage in the game in other parts of
the world with what is going on here, to see how it correlates with the information
feeds. The more diﬀerent data feeds we have access to, the easier it is to
verify.”
</p><!--l. 2132--><p class="indent" >  “You&#x2019;re hunting for terrorists,” Den translates.
</p><!--l. 2134--><p class="indent" >  She smiles. “Aren&#x2019;t you the suspicious one?”
</p><!--l. 2136--><p class="indent" >  He shrugs and she laughs.
</p><!--l. 2138--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s part of it. There are plenty of reasons for wanting to understand
all these various channels of cause and eﬀect. People are paying us to look
into this, and law enforcement wants it to be able to follow behaviour in the
game, because of all the private channels for communication. Possibilities for
evasion.”
</p><!--l. 2144--><p class="indent" >  Den pauses on the path to think. The conversation is interesting enough, but, “Why
me? I am not really one of the technical experts in the company.”
</p><!--l. 2147--><p class="indent" >  Kim turns to him. “I&#x2019;m afraid that was my idea. I thought of you because I know
that you have access to the roaming agents that your company has developed to pick
up on trends in the game, and that you have the right kind of overview. Also, having
listened to your talk – and having seen you in the ﬂesh, so to speak. . .” She winks at
him, sending a shot of adrenalin through his torso. “. . .you struck me as
someone I could work with. An ally. We might even be able to help each
other.”
</p><!--l. 2156--><p class="indent" >  Den nods at her, evenly. “Thank you. I&#x2019;m ﬂattered.”
</p><!--l. 2158--><p class="indent" >  “And there is something else I thought you could maybe help me with
too.”
</p><!--l. 2160--><p class="indent" >  His sideways glance is a question mark.
</p><!--l. 2162--><p class="indent" >  “Apart from the fact that this story leaked out, there has been other stuﬀ going
on.”
</p><!--l. 2165--><p class="indent" >  “What do you mean?”
</p><!--l. 2167--><p class="indent" >  “I have been getting strange data,” she tells him. “I was wondering if you have

heard of anything similar from the others involved.”
</p><!--l. 2170--><p class="indent" >  “What kind of data?”
</p><!--l. 2172--><p class="indent" >  “Glitches in the billboards. Sudden movements of players from centres of
attraction.”
</p><!--l. 2174--><p class="indent" >  “What kind of glitches?”
</p><!--l. 2176--><p class="indent" >  She nods, chewing a bite of her sub. Swallowing, “Some of the directed imaging
has not been working. Some of the content has been suppressed so we have had to
work around it. The high proﬁle regions that game sponsors want players to visit have
been less visited lately. I thought that, since you are in the business of attracting
people to those locations, you would have seen the trends. I mean, it seems as though
there is actually a trend to it, a pattern. But I do not have all the tools to ﬁnd out what
it is.”
</p><!--l. 2184--><p class="indent" >  “I haven&#x2019;t heard anything, but I can check it out. Maybe an error in the
speciﬁcation?”
</p><!--l. 2187--><p class="indent" >  She shakes her head. “The spec has been automatically veriﬁed. We have veriﬁed
the rule set using the best methods. There is money for that kind of thing from the
military. Always useful for something.”
</p><!--l. 2191--><p class="indent" >  “Well. . .” Den&#x2019;s training has taught him that what technical people claim is deﬁnite
and provable is often naive and only half the story. But he does not want to insult this
fascinating woman. If he plays his cards right, he could be spending the rest of his
visit in her company.
</p><!--l. 2196--><p class="indent" >  “At ﬁrst we thought it might be a hacker. There are deﬁnitely hackers in there
messing with stuﬀ. But that cannot really explain it.”
</p><!--l. 2200--><p class="indent" >  “So what can I do? I am just a package designer.”
</p><!--l. 2202--><p class="indent" >  “The packages are the key modules. If they are not doing their jobs then our game
is not paying for itself. These disruptions are a threat to your interest in the game too.
We want you to be aware of this problem and ﬁnd a safety net so that we can work
around the disruptions.”
</p><!--l. 2207--><p class="indent" >  “Isn&#x2019;t that a technological problem?”
</p><!--l. 2209--><p class="indent" >  ”Well, that would be a partial solution. But security is mainly a human matter. You
know, our sponsors are worried about this. There was a meeting last week at which
one of our group made a big song and dance about how important this was. if we
could solve this problem, they would like us a lot!”
</p><!--l. 2215--><p class="indent" >  “Enough to increase our fees?”
</p><!--l. 2217--><p class="indent" >  “Enough to make us the bee&#x2019;s knees, if you please!”
</p><!--l. 2219--><p class="indent" >  “I think I can do that,” he nods, seeing possibilities.
</p><!--l. 2221--><p class="indent" >  “Good,” she says, examining him more closely now. She pauses, as if considering
whether or not to proceed. “Can I ask you a question?”
</p><!--l. 2224--><p class="indent" >  He nods. “Go ahead.”
</p><!--l. 2226--><p class="indent" >  “I have a proposition for you.”
</p><!--l. 2228--><p class="indent" >  He waits.
</p><!--l. 2230--><p class="indent" >  “Would you like to do me a personal favour?” She turns towards him, channelling
her charm. If Den didn&#x2019;t know better, he would think she was trying to direct him.

What the hell. “I might like that very much.”.
</p><!--l. 2235--><p class="indent" >  “You could be rewarded handsomely for your services.” Her ﬂirtation is scarcely
concealed now.
</p><!--l. 2238--><p class="indent" >  “Well,” he says, turning to walk once again, putting his hand on her shoulder blade
and letting it slide down to the small of her back. “What do you have in mind
exactly?”

</p><!--l. 2249--><p class="indent" >  Dermot Macguire-Olsen&#x2019;s small oﬃce is a collage of mess, a cellular equilibrium
of multitudinous projects, tidied regularly but each possessing a life of its own and
apparently prospering. His borrowed room at Oslo&#x2019;s Computer Crime Team
headquarters is more a testament to his productivity than to his humanity. It&#x2019;s a sterile
room, he realizes, like its occupant. He hasn&#x2019;t added a single non-functional object to
it since arriving: not a picture, nor a plant, not a shred of personality. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">It&#x2019;s a ﬁling</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">cabinet. Even my clothes are boring. Christ.</span>
</p><!--l. 2258--><p class="indent" >  Dermot is not even a real investigator. True, he&#x2019;s been with the crime team for only
a short time, but that&#x2019;s not it. He has been telling himself repeatedly for years that he
would change all this. If he can just establish himself – his credentials as a systems
analyst, then he can relax a little and pay attention to these small details. When he no
longer has to ﬁght for the attention of his colleagues, then he can begin to reform his
miserable social life. New clothes, new apartment, new lifestyle. But he knows that it
is a race against time. He is not getting any younger. He has passed the awful barrier
of thirty and the longer he waits the harder it will be to learn how to socialize
again.
</p><!--l. 2270--><p class="indent" >  He looks around him, anywhere but at the monitor screen that has been giving him
a headache these last hours. The only trace of personality in this oﬃce is his tea
corner, he thinks. Dermot insists on making quality tea – none of this instant powder
nonsense. He receives freshly roasted, ﬁne-grain tea leaves of the highest quality from
the Cameron Highlands. It is a perk of his company&#x2019;s Malaysian outsourcing. It is the
same tea that they serve at the Raﬄes. It is one of his few pleasures, apart from
computer matters.
</p><!--l. 2279--><p class="indent" >  He gets up out of his seat and paces. It is better to get out of the chair once in a
while. So they say. But where is he going? The only place worth being is in the
computer. Jesus. How did it get to this? He does not feel quite at home here.
He is hungry but nor can he quite bring himself to take any food from the
canteen.

</p><!--l. 2286--><p class="indent" >  “Aren&#x2019;t you going to eat something?” a colleague asked him a while ago.
</p><!--l. 2288--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t know. Am I allowed to take this?” He does not yet feel as though he
belongs here in this group. It seems foreign and he does not understand the system. Is
it meant for him, an outsider?
</p><!--l. 2292--><p class="indent" >  He sits down again and looks at his combo. The screen-saver has cut in and is
ﬂagging him with one of the slogans he has programmed into it to boost his
self-esteem.

  <div class="verbatim" id="verbatim-1">

<!--l. 2299--><p class="nopar" > He hits the keyboard to remove it and goes back to his job and starts poring over the
code.
</p><!--l. 2303--><p class="indent" >  Dermot sees the code and admires the precision with which it has been
executed. A lot of it comes from his day job, so to speak. That is why he is here.
His company team is good, he thinks, partly due to his own inﬂuence. It
compares well with the ugly, styleless hackery of the original fragments they
received from the originators of the game. Then there is the code written in
Asia—formal and proper, occasionally clever but mostly just slickly competent and
drilled.
</p><!--l. 2311--><p class="indent" >  He picks up a piece of toast and chews absently on it, registering vaguely that
it is not pizza. His combo signals an incoming voice message. He clicks
in.
</p><!--l. 2315--><p class="indent" >  “Mr. Olsen?”
</p><!--l. 2317--><p class="indent" >  “Eh .. yes, what can I do for you?”
</p><!--l. 2319--><p class="indent" >  “My name is Ed Bishop. Am I disturbing you?”
</p><!--l. 2321--><p class="indent" >  “Uh no, go ahead.”
</p><!--l. 2323--><p class="indent" >  The voice continues. “You probably don&#x2019;t know me yet. I am leading a research
programme that is attached to your department. I have been travelling and have just
arrived in town. I was wondering if I could have a word with you. I spoke to your
department head and okayed it.”
</p><!--l. 2328--><p class="indent" >  Dermot is uncertain what to say. “Uhm. . .okay.” The caller ID looks legit&#x2019;.
</p><!--l. 2330--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ve been following your progress from afar.”
</p><!--l. 2332--><p class="indent" >  “Me? Why?”
</p><!--l. 2334--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ll explain later. Look, it&#x2019;s a nuisance for me to come out there. Could you meet
me downtown in a while?”
</p><!--l. 2337--><p class="indent" >  “I . . .”
</p><!--l. 2339--><p class="indent" >  “I okayed it with your department head. And you&#x2019;ll probably be going home soon
anyway? It&#x2019;s on your way.”
</p><!--l. 2342--><p class="indent" >  Dermot shrugs to himself. “Yes, I suppose so.”
</p><!--l. 2344--><p class="indent" >  “Good. I&#x2019;m looking forward to meeting you. See you in an hour and a
half?”
</p><!--l. 2346--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ll ask my . . .”
</p><!--l. 2348--><p class="indent" >  “Good, see you then!”
</p><!--l. 2350--><p class="indent" >  The connection breaks.

</p><!--l. 2352--><p class="indent" >  Danielsen, his supervisor, has been loitering in the hallway. He sticks his head
around the door. “So what did he say?”
</p><!--l. 2355--><p class="indent" >  “Some guy. You know him? He wants to meet me.”
</p><!--l. 2357--><p class="indent" >  “Bishop. He is a pretty important man. Smart fellow. It was he who suggested that
we recruit you to begin with.”
</p><!--l. 2360--><p class="indent" >  “No one told me that.”
</p><!--l. 2362--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s not important.”
</p><!--l. 2364--><p class="indent" >  “So I said I would go.”
</p><!--l. 2366--><p class="indent" >  “I think you should go.”
</p><!--l. 2368--><p class="indent" >  Dermot nods, thinking: break free and indulge.
</p><!--l. 2370--><p class="indent" >  “Then I&#x2019;ll go.”

</p><!--l. 2375--><p class="indent" >  Marketing for the post 2000 information age is a complex business, Den thinks.
Barraged with the incessant and the unprovoked, information becomes noise.
Communicating a message is no longer a simple problem. It becomes a battle of wits,
a matter of hacking the consumer. But consumers are receptive to the right things. If
you package things correctly, they will not merely read messages, they will go out and
buy the produce.
</p><!--l. 2383--><p class="indent" >  And it is all in the packaging. Lacking the time or inclination to contemplate,
modern Man and Woman allows the media to serve its ready-digested morsels,
regurgitated chunks of what passes for society&#x2019;s oﬃcial collective thinking. Why think
for yourself, if someone else is paid to do it for you?
</p><!--l. 2389--><p class="indent" >  Media. Where any idiot can write a book on the correct way to go to the bathroom. .
. Interactive television, or web. Even books. And mixed up in there, is the power to
manipulate the passive mind: you are a monkey, I am the scientist, you choose
what we decide. Just push the buttons in the right order and we&#x2019;ll give you
some sugar and tap your bank account. No, don&#x2019;t speak, I am afraid that
we do not permit language. Stick to the pre-programmed menus, you&#x2019;ll be
safer.
</p><!--l. 2397--><p class="indent" >  Den never questions the correctness of all of this. After all, he has been fed the
same opinion menu as everyone else from birth. Besides, the challenge of
manipulating people&#x2019;s thoughts is almost irresistible. The sheer audacity of it: the
sheer power which an awareness of the strategy entailed. Thinking is now only a
commodity for the masses, and creativity only for the elite.
</p><!--l. 2404--><p class="indent" >  He specializes in marketing the virtual reality. Not the electronic vision of
imagined worlds, but the common variety which has arisen in the post war United
States: the Disney land, car driving, hamburger eating buﬀer to Reality. The
developed world hasn&#x2019;t experienced Reality for years: a Chinese meal is not
a real Chinese meal, but a Safe Hong Kong Happy Meal which would not
be too diﬀerent from the Allowed Menu. Outdoors isn&#x2019;t safe. People drive

everywhere, never experiencing real air on their faces, instead charging around the
streets in a gloriﬁed video game, moving from air conditioned hallway to air
conditioned hallway. And in the midst of this virtual reality is the need for New
Things to satisfy a thirst for adventure. Of course it is precisely this marketing,
choice-control strategy which has eliminated the possibility of adventure in the ﬁrst
place for most of the Flock, but Den is not worried by this. After all, it is the
unattainable which we burn for: and that means that people will pay to achieve
it.
</p><!--l. 2421--><p class="indent" >  “You&#x2019;ll burn in Hell for your job description,” his virtual Chinese sister
has told him with a wink. Mary Cheung is an artiﬁcial self-styled girl of
the new millennium, with few hang ups. She occupies a diﬀerent world to
Den, an underground world of club reality which hardly does TV or Web.
Den doesn&#x2019;t disapprove of his sister. In spite of her lack of conformity to
conservative ideals, he ﬁnds her straightforward manner refreshing, after
all of the trickery and subterfuge of the real oﬃce. That is why he made
her.
</p><!--l. 2430--><p class="indent" >  She has left a message for him and has agreed to meet him, on a park bench in
VLondon, where they can talk privately. Most of her reports are routine stuﬀ,
but every now and then there is a speciﬁc alert. In the privacy of his hotel
room, he dons his glasses and hooks into the system with his mobile. After
selecting his destination, his doorway opens into a side-street in downtown
VLondon.
</p><!--l. 2438--><p class="indent" >  The side-street breathes with living surfaces, dominated by nano-slogans and URLs
changing slowly so as not to disturb the balance of those trying to navigate. He takes a
moment to acclimatize himself and then emerges into the main street. He has
selected a privacy mode so that they will not be disturbed by others moving
through the region. They will have this region to themselves, for the extra
expense.
</p><!--l. 2446--><p class="indent" >  Up ahead is a small square park, with two benches overlooking a circle of grass.
Low hedges provide a feeling of closure. As he arrives, she is already waiting,
legs together, but outstretched to the pavement, leaning forward, dressed in
the usual black gear which contrasts with the many coloured stripes in her
bleach-blonde hair. A mini skirt over black tights, leather platform-boots up to her
knees. It is not diﬃcult to see her amongst the advertising; she is practically
monochrome. She is wearing a fashion mask; it is a fragile spaghetti of ﬁne
dark wiring, aﬃxed by some mysterious means which deﬁes physics. Behind
the wires, her Oriental features add a calm pool of beauty to the decorative
distractions.
</p><!--l. 2459--><p class="indent" >  For the ﬁrst time, Den ﬁnds it marginally disturbing that she has some of the traits
of Cathy Kim. Perhaps it was prescience on his part. He is a man, after all, and not
always in control of his fantasies.
</p><!--l. 2463--><p class="indent" >  “Hi.”
</p><!--l. 2465--><p class="indent" >  “Denny. Howz things?” She is always cool.

</p><!--l. 2467--><p class="indent" >  “Great. You?”
</p><!--l. 2469--><p class="indent" >  “Startlingly aware of the world around me. Otherwise ﬁne.” She winks coyly and
knowingly, suddenly reaching forward to brush something from her sculpted
boots.
</p><!--l. 2473--><p class="indent" >  “Good. You called me. You have information.”
</p><!--l. 2475--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ve been scouting, meeting people. ”
</p><!--l. 2477--><p class="indent" >  A Christian angel is hanging around, croaking its worn-out hymns and crawling on
its belly in the street. It ﬂaps its wings spasmodically, begging for Belief amongst the
pigeons. It is almost impossible to exorcize these from private rooms. They
have rights that few other characters in the game have. Den kicks an empty
coke can at its blackened form, to shoo it away and sits down. Can&#x2019;t escape
the damned Christian missionaries, but his ﬁlters make them all look like
shit.
</p><!--l. 2486--><p class="indent" >  “Tell me about the alarm.”
</p><!--l. 2488--><p class="indent" >  “I found an involvement of class one software corporation in online services. Alarm
fourteen,”
</p><!--l. 2491--><p class="indent" >  She is true craftsmanship. Her diction is almost ﬂawless.
</p><!--l. 2494--><p class="indent" >  “Okay, tell me more.”
</p><!--l. 2496--><p class="indent" >  She tosses her head slightly and looks up as she speaks, giving her a slightly bitchy
edge, just right. “Street sellers in Bangkok are now oﬀering portals for sex
services using a new proprietary protocol. It has the signature of a class one. It
seems to be tied to some special hardware. I&#x2019;ve captured the signature for
you.” She hands him a small ball, which is a representation of a data ﬁle. He
stuﬀs it in his pocket for later, eﬀectively transferring the ﬁle to his private
storage.
</p><!--l. 2505--><p class="indent" >  “How many cases have you seen?”
</p><!--l. 2507--><p class="indent" >  She shrugs. “No established trend yet. It might just be a prototype in testing, but it
was public. It was more of an anomaly event than a repeated signal.”
</p><!--l. 2511--><p class="indent" >  Interesting, Den thinks. A class one software company is a major player with a
virtual monopoly interest. Why would they be involved in the sex trade? “Were there
any unusual signs?”
</p><!--l. 2515--><p class="indent" >  “Well this is interesting,” Mary says. “I managed to observe the stream from the
second session I found. It was encrypted, but an analysis of the stream indicates an
alphabet of about thirty characters, plus or minus ten percent. It could be Cyrillic or it
could be Scandinavian.”
</p><!--l. 2520--><p class="indent" >  “Not American? Even more interesting.” He pauses to think and she waits with the
deﬁant look of someone with an attitude. It is a feature that he requested long ago to
make her more sexy.
</p><!--l. 2524--><p class="indent" >  “How many people using it?”
</p><!--l. 2526--><p class="indent" >  “Not many. it seems quite new. My guess is that it is just a prototype under
development. Maybe some underground sex shop has been recruited to test it. It might
be mainly local, and someone jut happened to interface it into the game by
accident.”

</p><!--l. 2531--><p class="indent" >  He nods to himself. “Yes, that could be it. But if someone is making a new protocol
then it means they have come up with some new hardware or software that they hope
is going to win against the competition. See if you can ﬁnd out more about it. How
large is your contact graph?”
</p><!--l. 2537--><p class="indent" >  Mary pretends to be consulting her mobile. It is a visual trick that is useful for
allowing time for informational searches in a plausible behavioural way. “I have just
about ten probable nodes on it.”
</p><!--l. 2541--><p class="indent" >  Den does not feel hopeful. If her web of contacts, related to this incident, is only ten
nodes then it could take some time to follow sensible leads. Just as well this is not a
high priority matter; but it is important enough to warrant an alarm from Mary
Cheung. He makes a note on his own pad to remember this. “Okay,” he says. “Remind
me about this in one week, would you?”
</p><!--l. 2548--><p class="indent" >  “Roger dodger.”
</p><!--l. 2550--><p class="indent" >  “Oh, and would you do me a favour? Find out whatever you can about a Cathy
Kim, working at the Supercomputer Center here in San Diego.”
</p><!--l. 2553--><p class="indent" >  “Someone you know?”
</p><!--l. 2555--><p class="indent" >  He nods. “Someone I just met.”
</p><!--l. 2557--><p class="indent" >  She nudges him. “Interesting. Anyone I should know about?”
</p><!--l. 2559--><p class="indent" >  He laughs. “Not yet. Just ﬁnd out who she is, what she does, something about her
background. You know, the usual stuﬀ.” He pauses. “Mary, any other stuﬀ you should
tell me about?”
</p><!--l. 2563--><p class="indent" >  “Sure. I have a trend report. Increasing numbers of American players going to the
Middle-East sims. They are probably kids, or at least juveniles. Behavioural patterns
suggest an average mental age of sixteen on the U.K. scale. They are headed to the
interfaced battles; you know, the ones that are tied into real military activity. A lot of
prostitutes are moving into the area too, targeting them. They seem to originate from
the Mid-East itself, especially Jordan.”
</p><!--l. 2571--><p class="indent" >  “Figures.” He runs through some notes on his mobile, imagining that he has
already thought about this, but does not ﬁnd a note. “What are these kids
doing?”
</p><!--l. 2575--><p class="indent" >  “Some of them are just playing amongst the real action, for the thrill of having a
game room in which the action is based on what they can see on the TV or web-cam.
Others are actually helping the combatants in the U.S. and British Armies,
either by hooking into the control systems and monitoring or by voting on
targets.”
</p><!--l. 2581--><p class="indent" >  “Sheesh,” Den mutters. “These days there are more people voting in these reality
things than vote in the fucking democracy.”
</p><!--l. 2584--><p class="indent" >  “Hey, sweetie, you know that the days of democracy are long gone out
there.”
</p><!--l. 2587--><p class="indent" >  “What else?”
</p><!--l. 2589--><p class="indent" >  “A herd of Christian missionary succubi is now spreading through much of the
game.”
</p><!--l. 2592--><p class="indent" >  He grunts.

</p><!--l. 2594--><p class="indent" >  “PhoxHollywood has started deploying robot ﬁghters in the war regions that can be
activated on the sim. Kids can basically ﬁght for the Army within certain
parameters.”
</p><!--l. 2598--><p class="indent" >  That&#x2019;s right, he thinks. One of the Ivy League colleges built a system for them to
work like a virtual machine with certain policy based constraints, so willing ﬁghters
can use their cognitive abilities to remote control certain slow robots. The
army commanders can limit their capabilities. It was based on an old student
project.
</p><!--l. 2604--><p class="indent" >  “The next level of gaming,”. Is someone sponsoring the advertising?
</p><!--l. 2606--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t know, but they are selling advertising on the control panels. I think the
National Riﬂe Foundation might be involved.”
</p><!--l. 2609--><p class="indent" >  “That makes sense,” he notes. “And I can probably can ﬁnd out on Sunday. They
have an interest in the game already. Someone will be at the reception.”
</p><!--l. 2613--><p class="indent" >  Den glances at the time on his display. “Okay, honey. Anything else? I have to leave
soon.”
</p><!--l. 2616--><p class="indent" >  “Not much. There is a new trend in group art that seems to be growing in
importance in Germany and Eastern Europe.”
</p><!--l. 2619--><p class="indent" >  “What is group art?”
</p><!--l. 2621--><p class="indent" >  “Usually it is animated dance sequences with choreographed colour and music. It is
usually a group activity, but the groups can be of any size. I have seen forty-seven
projects of this kind in VBerlin alone in the last two weeks.”
</p><!--l. 2626--><p class="indent" >  “Potential?”
</p><!--l. 2628--><p class="indent" >  “Marketing category has not yet been established. I need more data to go on. The
groups seem to be quite diverse. Think of Einstürzende Neubauten playing with a
theatre group.”
</p><!--l. 2632--><p class="indent" >  “Go on.”
</p><!--l. 2634--><p class="indent" >  “No more signiﬁcant trends above noise levels. Encounters. One possible
recognition as a sim while listening on a private room, standard surveillance. Two
sexual encounters: one male business executive and one teenage boy. Nothing to
report from the standard protocol.”
</p><!--l. 2640--><p class="indent" >  Den makes a note to review the protocol for handling sexual encounters. Possibly
the questions and subtle trickery of the protocol is no longer eﬀective in divulging the
identities. “Was the boy genuine?”
</p><!--l. 2645--><p class="indent" >  “The responses indicated a behaviour consistent with a ﬁfteen year old. He was just
looking for a good time.”
</p><!--l. 2648--><p class="indent" >  Mary is programmed to engage with people whom she suspects might provide
information about her mission objectives. Perhaps he should also program some more
inhibitions into her.
</p><!--l. 2653--><p class="indent" >  “Okay, Mary, my sweet. What about background trends? How are the billboards
working out?”
</p><!--l. 2656--><p class="indent" >  She pauses momentarily, as if the response time of the software is sluggish.
“Not too bad, since you mention it. We are within our proposed margins
of tolerance, although the anti-aging drug stuﬀ is on the limits. It could be

better.”
</p><!--l. 2661--><p class="indent" >  “Damn,” he mutters, and thinks: I hate that stuﬀ. Imagine what it would be like if
we all lived to be ﬁve hundred years old. People are already insuﬀerably
self-righteous when they are ﬁfty!
</p><!--l. 2665--><p class="indent" >  “Society demands beauty, conformism, Denny.”
</p><!--l. 2667--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Youth is not just appearance, it&#x2019;s innocence.</span>
</p><!--l. 2670--><p class="indent" >  He smiles now at his sister. He actually likes talking to her, even though he knows
that her brain is scattered across the ﬂoor-space of a large underground cavern,
somewhere in the Welsh mountainside.. “But you go against the grain all the time,
girl..”
</p><!--l. 2675--><p class="indent" >  She sniggers with a big smile, sensing the change in conversation dynamic. “I go
with whoever I want,” she laughs. “You know: &#x2019;n&#x2019;the creed &#x2019;n&#x2019; the colour and the
name don&#x2019;t matter. . ..
</p><!--l. 2679--><p class="indent" >  “Some of our competitors&#x2019; campaigns are doing well,” she adds. “S&#x0026;S are making
a fortune in returns on their political advertising. It&#x2019;s all funded by big companies or
sponsors. Of course it&#x2019;s all a tax dodge. They seem to be able to support
the funding of these campaigns to invest in future relief. I understand that
the Chinese government has made advances to them to commission some
work.”
</p><!--l. 2687--><p class="indent" >  “The Americans will never allow that,” he thinks aloud. “These old states have to
break eventually.”
</p><!--l. 2690--><p class="indent" >  “My strategy analysis gives a sixty percent probability that ﬂooding these areas
with multiple messages is the optimal vector for breaking down the old propaganda in
the populations.”
</p><!--l. 2694--><p class="indent" >  “Maybe they are not strong enough to defy the will of dogma. They are still the
victims of the advertising of a bygone era.”
</p><!--l. 2697--><p class="indent" >  “Emphasis on bygone. The propaganda messages are no longer really eﬀective. you
know. It now seems to be a generational eﬀect. Word of mouth, old prejudices, you
know. Passed on from father to son, mother to daughter. Kids will believe
anything.”
</p><!--l. 2702--><p class="indent" >  Den purses his lips, dislodging his glasses slightly and providing a disorienting
tremor in the landscape from the orientation sensors. “Maybe we are crazy to
be chasing these new techniques when the old ones are still winning out
there.”
</p><!--l. 2707--><p class="indent" >  Mary looks him squarely in the eye now. “If I were you, I would embrace your little
madnesses. That&#x2019;s what makes you an individual. Everything else is just the collective
myth of ‘what is Natural, what is Right, what is Normal&#x2019;. Do you really want to be
that much of a good doggie . . .do what we tell you because you are no diﬀerent than
we are? Says who!”
</p><!--l. 2714--><p class="indent" >  Well, she is doing her job, he thinks. If he ever needed reminding of how to do his
company duty, Mary would be the one to remind him.
</p><!--l. 2717--><p class="indent" >  “One more report,” she adds. “A low-grade resource anomaly on the Dubai
billboards, but it is spreading slowly. Is could be a systematic problem in its early

stages.”
</p><!--l. 2721--><p class="indent" >  He nods and makes a note. “Right. Thanks, M.”, he says. “Now get back out there,
girl. Do your thing.”
</p><!--l. 2724--><p class="indent" >  He pulls the plug on the simulation, suﬀering a momentary disorientation
as the image vanishes. She is pretty good, he thinks, but not quite ﬂawless
yet. When he gets back to the U.K. he should arrange a meeting with the
designers to make some adjustments .They should always be on the cutting
edge.
</p><!--l. 2730--><p class="indent" >  He removes the glasses and rubs his eyes. It is dark outside now. He has been
working for several hours and feels like going for a swim. He checks his list for the
day and makes some notes. The swim will have to wait. He&#x2019;d better check
out this anomaly in VDubai ﬁrst. If it is a sign of a problem, it could cost
them.
</p><!--l. 2736--><p class="indent" >  He adjusts his navigation settings and reenters the simulation in downtown VDubai.
This is a place of respite and luxury shopping where people meet to party and live a
little Arabian fantasy. A thousand and one bites, someone called it. Better than a
thousand and one ﬁghts. That would have to be Iraq.
</p><!--l. 2742--><p class="indent" >  Den homes in on the location of the billboard that Mary discovered. It is in a
downtown market, in a small passageway amongst street sellers. There is a signiﬁcant
amount of detailing here in the backdrops. There are many characters wandering
about in the market. Many of them are sims, but the rendering is pretty high quality. It
costs to visit this part of the VR, so a lot of eﬀort is placed on the perception of
luxury. Den ﬁnds the billboard. It is a Persian carpet with a changing image, like a
‘nano-shirt&#x2019;.
</p><!--l. 2751--><p class="indent" >  The billboard text is overlaid with something else. It looks like an error in the
coding. The layers have gone wrong. Den reads the billboard. It says:

</p>
  <div class="verbatim" id="verbatim-2">
BUY THIS $(enticement)EXAS WESTERN CAMPS.
 <br />FREE: DOUBLE SLOT ALLOCATION.
 <br />BARGAIN PRICES FOR TOTAL DEAL.
</div>
<!--l. 2758--><p class="nopar" >
</p><!--l. 2761--><p class="indent" >  Obviously a coding error. When people see this, a small percentage will be drawn
away to the Western ﬁght camps in VTexas, just to see what they are. No one has
authorized or paid for this. It needs to be ﬁxed.
</p><!--l. 2765--><p class="indent" >  He checks his monitor channel. The scenery turns blue and ﬁlls slowly up with
information about cause-eﬀect relationships, current scheduling tasks and
priorities.
</p><!--l. 2769--><p class="indent" >  The game is trying to reallocate some resources now. The intensity of the activity
around the market and the nearby warring region has apparently become too much.
Now, instead of denying access to the game, it is asking the players to move to a
separate simulator where they can receive a diﬀerent package. This peculiar error
message is probably a by-product of that.
</p><!--l. 2776--><p class="indent" >  Den is no expert on the technicalities of the sims but he knows the kinds of failures
that are common. Each of the processors is designed to implement a diﬀerent
package. The packages are diﬀerent public relations programs, that work
on diﬀerent aspects of public awareness. This does not look like a normal
error.
</p><!--l. 2782--><p class="indent" >  What is strange here is that all of the characters near by are running in minimal
detail mode. They all looks like ghostly apparitions, with no distinguishing marks. It
is hardly the opulence that one would expect in Dubai.
</p><!--l. 2787--><p class="indent" >  As far as he understands it, the architecture is such that if one of the packages
becomes so successful as to attract too many occupants, these processors become
overloaded and one of two contingencies ensues. Either there is positive feedback and
the package self-destructs and dies oﬀ, like a woolly mammoth. Or there is negative
feedback regulation and it levels oﬀ to some stable equilibrium.
</p><!--l. 2794--><p class="indent" >  Now it seems that some of the regions are trying to regulate the ﬂows. Den cannot
exactly understand why though. It does not seem as though there is a signiﬁcant load
on this package processor. The Middle East has always been a favourite battle
ground and is given a high processing capacity by Pentagon sponsorship, but
lately there have been other attractors like the volcano rescue. It is almost
as though one of the sensors is reporting incorrectly. He makes a note to
submit a bug report to the programmer bug-tracking system. Within minutes
it will be available to programmers all over the planet, probably in the Far
East..
</p><!--l. 2805--><p class="indent" >  He begins to fear something that he has been expecting for some time. How long

would it take hackers to get into the system? The game is supposed to be the most
secure programming construct ever, built entirely using modern resistant methods,
with fault tolerance and every kind of robustness feature. It hardly seems likely, but
who knows?
</p><!--l. 2811--><p class="indent" >  Den keys in a request for communication on his virtual mobile and makes his
report, noting the hidden ID of the billboard surface. He receives an immediate
conﬁrmation back, but something unnerves him about the error. His intuition bells are
ﬂapping restlessly. Perhaps he should call someone.
</p><!--l. 2817--><p class="indent" >  He keys in a message to the operations centre that watches over the system
worldwide. He has spoken to people there before. They can at least investigate the
problem.
</p><!--l. 2821--><p class="indent" >  “I have entered a bug report on the game. Here&#x2019;s the ref.” He ﬂashes the code.
“There does not seem to be a good reason for the behaviour. My guess is that
something is going wrong in the resource allocation.”
</p><!--l. 2826--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, yes. That sounds strange. Well I don&#x2019;t know what it could be”
</p><!--l. 2828--><p class="indent" >  “So how do you want to deal with this?”
</p><!--l. 2830--><p class="indent" >  “Well, it looks as though someone has entered a report for it.”
</p><!--l. 2832--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, I just told you I did.”
</p><!--l. 2834--><p class="indent" >  “You did?”
</p><!--l. 2836--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, I just said that.”
</p><!--l. 2838--><p class="indent" >  “Well, we&#x2019;d better give them some time to look into it then.”
</p><!--l. 2840--><p class="indent" >  “Perhaps you would let me know when you ﬁnd out?”
</p><!--l. 2842--><p class="indent" >  “Well, we have a lot of temperamental artists working on the game. We try to keep
them to a discipline, but you know how it is.”
</p><!--l. 2845--><p class="indent" >  Den is not sure how to respond. “This might be urgent. If there is an attack in
progress. . . Don&#x2019;t you have a procedure for handling this kind of thing?”
</p><!--l. 2849--><p class="indent" >  “I suppose we&#x2019;ll have to wait for a little artistic inspiration.”
</p><!--l. 2851--><p class="indent" >  Artistic inspiration is bullshit, he thinks. You just have to ﬁx this. There is no Aleph
moment of Self-Realization when you have a ﬂashing vision of a complete work of
art. Only the ﬂakes claim that. Ideas are vague. It&#x2019;s up to the professional to make
them work. With hard graft.

</p><!--l. 2862--><p class="indent" >  Cold rain is pouring from the gutter lining the small canopy which protects him
from an autumn deluge. Dermot has been waiting for almost half an hour; the chill
wind, combined with the dampness, has penetrated to his bones. He shivers and looks
grumpily at his wrist strap. A tram rumbles past the cloister mall, grinding a metallic
chime on the tracks as it takes the corner.
</p><!--l. 2869--><p class="indent" >  He watches a group of women coming out of the store across the road. Autumn
fashions are on display. It interleaves a frantic eﬀort to solve the problem in his head,
the problem that he was wrenched from to come here. Why does he have to come here
anyway? What&#x2019;s wrong with his oﬃce? Honestly, his mind is elsewhere, on a problem
that has been consuming him for some time—a bug in the game that seems quite
inexplicable. He knows of the expression “emergent phenomena” but this
phenomenon is surely amongst the strangest to emerge in any system that he has
known.
</p><!--l. 2878--><p class="indent" >  A van drives past, making a noisy ﬂapping sound as the tyres cross the wet cobbles.
It was not long ago that the government pedestrianised Oslo, but deliveries still get
through as long as they are combustionless carriages. Strictly speaking, the van should
not be allowed to display moving advertisements on its chassis, but people are always
bending the rules.
</p><!--l. 2885--><p class="indent" >  Ten years ago, he would not have reacted to the noise of a van. For years they have
covered up the meticulously laid cobble stones, which paved the streets of Oslo,
pouring tarmac over them for the beneﬁt of the motor car. Each year, the snow and
frost crack and disintegrate the soft asphalt on the hard stone sitting atop Oslo&#x2019;s
marshy foundation and the result is a lethal mess of pot-holes—an even worse surface
to drive on than the stones themselves. Sometimes technology does not help us with
our ailment, he thinks. Now they have begun to rediscover the interleaving dove-tail
mosaics, weaving stonework in and out of surviving and resurrected tram-lines.
Normal traﬃc is banned from the centre and replaced with trams, and electric
busses equipped with all-weather tyres. Now even the smallest intrusion is

conspicuous.
</p><!--l. 2899--><p class="indent" >  He shifts uncomfortably from foot to foot, annoyed that he was distracted from
his work by so idle a thought. He does not feel that he has time to waste.
Too many commitments to allow such petty observations to intrude on his
time.
</p><!--l. 2904--><p class="indent" >  A man appears suddenly from nowhere, standing next to him.
</p><!--l. 2906--><p class="indent" >  “Mr. Crusoe, I presume? Or may I just call you Rob?” he smiles.
</p><!--l. 2908--><p class="indent" >  Dermot turns.
</p><!--l. 2910--><p class="indent" >  “Thank you for coming, Mr. Olsen.”
</p><!--l. 2912--><p class="indent" >  “Macguire-Olsen, Dermot,” Dermot corrects.
</p><!--l. 2914--><p class="indent" >  “Ah I&#x2019;m sorry, Macguire-Olsen. You have mixed parents?”
</p><!--l. 2916--><p class="indent" >  Dermot nods, “A man and a woman.”
</p><!--l. 2918--><p class="indent" >  The man chuckles amicably. “Perhaps I can just call you Dermot.”
</p><!--l. 2920--><p class="indent" >  “Most people do.”
</p><!--l. 2922--><p class="indent" >  “And my name is Bishop, Ed Bishop.”
</p><!--l. 2924--><p class="indent" >  Dermot smiles skeptically. Bishop. This man was supposed to be an American, but
he is clearly of Norwegian descent. Scandinavian eyes too big, too wide, fearful with
the panic of meeting someone. A face that does not look straight on, but snatches a
glance here and there out of the corner of the eye. The wrinkles of apprehension
around the forehead. These are distinctly Norwegian traits, Dermot thinks. He asks:
“You are the man I spoke to, on voice-only?”
</p><!--l. 2932--><p class="indent" >  The man nods. “You look cold. Should we get a cup of coﬀee? I hear they have
good cake here.” His accent sounds American at least.
</p><!--l. 2935--><p class="indent" >  Dermot shivers and nods, clenching his sodden, numb ﬁngers. He puts doubts on
hold, to attend to the more urgent matter of getting dry and warm.
</p><!--l. 2939--><p class="indent" >  Something about the size of this man that lends him authority. He has the feel of a
policeman or of the military, though nothing else about his appearance would suggest
it. “All right.”
</p><!--l. 2943--><p class="indent" >  They walk up the few steps into the cloister ring and push through the old wooden
doorway into a cafe that has recently been crowded with after a rush. “Tea-room”
hangs a sign, “Please look after your belongings. Thieves operate in this area.”. The
café is now almost empty, but is still littered with the remains of yet-to-be-collected
cups and crockery.
</p><!--l. 2950--><p class="indent" >  “What about this table in the corner?”
</p><!--l. 2952--><p class="indent" >  He edges past the round dark-wood tables to a table with a window view of the
cloisters, through rose-patterned iron-mongery. It is somewhat concealed behind a
steep spiral staircase, also of wrought-iron, just about wide enough for a slender
person to climb. The steps corkscrew up to a second level amongst the rafters of this
old building; a sign hangs there: “Stairway to Heaven”.
</p><!--l. 2959--><p class="indent" >  Up there, in the rooﬁng, is a mezzanine level; small cherubs hang on strings from
the ceiling, complementing ornate wood-carvings that are set into the stone wall. This
stairwell is known as the most dangerous café staircase in the city. Sitting underneath
it is asking for trouble, but there does not seem to be much choice. Dermot has seen

glasses and drinks come crashing down as people get dizzy or simply try to carry too
much.
</p><!--l. 2967--><p class="indent" >  He shivers in the warm room. Anticipation has taken hold of his physiology, but
warmth has not yet nourished him. Nerves tingle, though he would not say that he felt
nervous. When this man, Bishop his name, called him on an encrypted line and started
cautiously picking his brains, he was not quite sure what to make of him. He is not
even a hundred percent sure what he is doing here now. Something about what he said
intrigued him.
</p><!--l. 2975--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t usually do these kinds of meetings,” Bishop says, as he squeezes his large
frame into the wooden chair. “I am just a researcher. In charge of a project, yes, but
still. But it turns out that my nephew was sick and I was going to have to come to
Oslo anyway. It made a rationalization of my schedule possible, so here I
am.”
</p><!--l. 2982--><p class="indent" >  “You have family here then,” Dermot digs.
</p><!--l. 2984--><p class="indent" >  “Yes. I grew up in the States but most of my family is here. What about
you?”
</p><!--l. 2986--><p class="indent" >  “My mother is Irish. My dad was from the west of Norway.”
</p><!--l. 2988--><p class="indent" >  “Ah, and you grew up here?”
</p><!--l. 2990--><p class="indent" >  “Pretty much.”
</p><!--l. 2992--><p class="indent" >  Padlocked, ornate iron grills cover the windows; a ﬂoral design, in keeping with
the style of the cloisters. There is a lot of iron here. It is a cage, but a cosy
cage.
</p><!--l. 2996--><p class="indent" >  “So—what do they have to eat here?”
</p><!--l. 2998--><p class="indent" >  “I dunno. We can get a menu.”
</p><!--l. 3000--><p class="indent" >  “Let&#x2019;s do that.” He turn around in his seat, looking for someone to ask. “No one
seems to have seen us.”
</p><!--l. 3003--><p class="indent" >  “They&#x2019;ll come.”
</p><!--l. 3005--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, I expect so. Are you hungry? I would like something. . .” He looks
conspicuously around some more.
</p><!--l. 3008--><p class="indent" >  Dermot feels awkward, wishing they could just get on with the matter at
hand.
</p><!--l. 3010--><p class="indent" >  “Actually, I am wondering why we are here.”
</p><!--l. 3012--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, yes, of course.” Bishop meets his gaze. “I&#x2019;m sorry. I spend so much time
working on these projects that it&#x2019;s easy to forget that no one else knows what I
actually do!” He laughs in a careful way and pauses as if to reign himself in again.
“Ok.” Bishop reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small slate mobile. He thumbs in
a short sequence and transmits his ID to Dermot&#x2019;s mobile by direct link. It beeps in
conﬁrmation. Dermot glances at his wrist strap and touches it to see the conﬁrmation
of identity. It is marked with the oﬃcial Norwegian and European police logos and
signatures.
</p><!--l. 3022--><p class="indent" >  He nods. “Thanks.”
</p><!--l. 3024--><p class="indent" >  “So now you know who I am, let&#x2019;s get down to business.” He sends a glance
towards one of the serving staﬀ. “Let me ask you, Dermot. How much do you actually

know about the game you are working on?”
</p><!--l. 3029--><p class="indent" >  Dermot shrugs. “Depends on what you mean. I know the code pretty well in
chunks. I am not into all the details, but I have to know enough. I could put
together another program like it if I had the resources. If that is what you
mean?”
</p><!--l. 3034--><p class="indent" >  “No, that&#x2019;s not what I had in mind.”
</p><!--l. 3036--><p class="indent" >  He stops as a waitress arrives to take their order. They look at each other
expectantly. “Eh perhaps you would bring us a menu,” he says to the girl.
</p><!--l. 3040--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ll just have a coke,” Dermot says promptly, snatching a frustrated glance at her.
She is wearing a the tightly ﬁtting black uniform. He feels momentarily annoyed with
himself again for being distracted.
</p><!--l. 3045--><p class="indent" >  The man, Bishop, or whatever his name is, falters and says, “Ok, just bring me a
coﬀee and a piece of cake.”
</p><!--l. 3048--><p class="indent" >  “What kind of cake would you like? We have cheesecake, carrot cake, choc. .
.”
</p><!--l. 3050--><p class="indent" >  “Chocolate sounds perfect,” he says, smiling at her.
</p><!--l. 3052--><p class="indent" >  Dermot admires the way he captures her attention, looking at her full-on. He
wishes that he could get someone&#x2019;s attention like that. He feels anonymous, as
usual.
</p><!--l. 3056--><p class="indent" >  “Okay. And that&#x2019;s a regular coﬀee?”
</p><!--l. 3058--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, thank you.”
</p><!--l. 3060--><p class="indent" >  “Fine,” she chirps, ﬂashes him a smile, and swings around to hurry back to the
kitchen bar.
</p><!--l. 3063--><p class="indent" >  Bishop, or whatever he&#x2019;s called, turns back to face Dermot and continues. “Where
were we? Yes. Do you understand the true nature of the game?”
</p><!--l. 3066--><p class="indent" >  “What do you mean?”
</p><!--l. 3068--><p class="indent" >  “I mean that the game, as you know it, is not just a game. That is one of the reasons
why we are investigating it, and following its development. Of course it is much more
than just a game. It is a whole environment. It mixes play with chat and with
advertising and politics. It is a game with a hidden agenda. It is a meeting place, a
shopping mall, you name it.”
</p><!--l. 3075--><p class="indent" >  “What kind of agenda?”
</p><!--l. 3077--><p class="indent" >  “You don&#x2019;t know? You haven&#x2019;t thought about it?”
</p><!--l. 3079--><p class="indent" >  “Well, no.” he says, feeling a little put out. “I might be a little behind, I suppose.
I&#x2019;ve only been here for a couple of months. I am still looking at the security and
privacy coding. My job is. . .”
</p><!--l. 3083--><p class="indent" >  “I know what your job is. And what it is going to be.” He adds: “I was the one who
got you on the team. We need your expertise.”
</p><!--l. 3086--><p class="indent" >  “I heard that.”
</p><!--l. 3088--><p class="indent" >  “And you probably wonder why.”
</p><!--l. 3090--><p class="indent" >  Dermot nods.
</p><!--l. 3092--><p class="indent" >  “Well, it is a long story, if we go into details. Let&#x2019;s just say the cat is out of the bag
as far as the game is concerned.”

</p><!--l. 3095--><p class="indent" >  “You mean . . . its agenda?”
</p><!--l. 3097--><p class="indent" >  “Exactly.”
</p><!--l. 3099--><p class="indent" >  “So what is it?”
</p><!--l. 3101--><p class="indent" >  “Well, that is a bit like asking: what is the agenda of politics. It is a new meeting
place. A place where people come together and interact, free of these social groupings
that bind social groups in reality.”
</p><!--l. 3105--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s a game though.”
</p><!--l. 3107--><p class="indent" >  Bishop nods patiently. “Have you heard of the Wilkinson report?”
</p><!--l. 3109--><p class="indent" >  Dermot searches his memory for something, staring into the dark wood-grain of
their little table. “Wasn&#x2019;t it something to do with the role of the police in the coming
decade? I think I saw a documentary about it.”
</p><!--l. 3113--><p class="indent" >  “Yes it was,” he says, clearly impressed. “It was a report that was written in
summary of a conference between the United States and the European Union
police forces, some years ago. Basically it says that what we see going on
today is a fundamental fragmentation of society caused by communications
privacy.”
</p><!--l. 3119--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah.. Yeah. I think I remember.”
</p><!--l. 3121--><p class="indent" >  “Do you remember the content?”
</p><!--l. 3123--><p class="indent" >  He shrugs.
</p><!--l. 3125--><p class="indent" >  “Well, some of what the report says is just sour grapes for not getting their way
with surveillance laws, all those years ago—you know, when mobile technologies
were new. The rest of it is a rather insightful analysis of our social condition and the
breakdown of law and order.”
</p><!--l. 3131--><p class="indent" >  Dermot waits for explanation. His eyes roam and he is impressed by the detailing of
the room. Wooden carvings, ﬂoral iron-mongery. It belongs to a diﬀerent age. The
recursion and repetition of pattern makes it look like a piece of computer code.
Perhaps we are all living inside someone else&#x2019;s simulation, he thinks. Kudos to the
programmer.
</p><!--l. 3137--><p class="indent" >  “All right. So the bottom line is that police forces around the world are worried that
they might be losing their grip. The idea is that the society is fragmenting because
people are giving priority to conversations with close associates, rather than to those
around them. You see, before we had all of these devices for modern electronic
telepathy, the limitations of physical contact were, in a sense, actually beneﬁcial in
mixing people up. Society is basically like a colloid – a mixture of liquids that do not
want to mix. You have to keep mixing it, or else little globules groups will
form that do not mix in and one has a multi-dimensional apartheid; not just
blacks and whites, but every imaginable social distinction forming their own
sub-cultures.”
</p><!--l. 3150--><p class="indent" >  “I suppose so. So what?”
</p><!--l. 3152--><p class="indent" >  “Oh! We can see it happening. If you study anthropology, you ﬁnd that humans are
wired for social groups that are about thirty strong.”
</p><!--l. 3156--><p class="indent" >  Dermot believes he has read something like that.
</p><!--l. 3158--><p class="indent" >  “We can maintain an acquaintance list of about a hundred friends and relatives, but

our tolerance level for close contact is around thirty. The trouble is that our mobiles
have put us in touch with a much larger number than that, and so people are starting to
be more selective in who they talk to. Not only that, but they can have private
conversations that are not really bound to a physical reality where you get all
those important physical signals that tell you when you are doing something
wrong.”
</p><!--l. 3167--><p class="indent" >  “No body language.”
</p><!--l. 3169--><p class="indent" >  “No body language—and no moderation. If you can dial up just those people who
agree with you, and keep out those who don&#x2019;t, then there is no moderating inﬂuence
on your opinions.” He pauses to see if Dermot is comprehending him. “People
become extremists.”
</p><!--l. 3175--><p class="indent" >  Again, he pauses, looking at Dermot to see if he is following.
</p><!--l. 3177--><p class="indent" >  “You see, society is dependent on mixing. Humans only form a broad consensus of
opinion if they meet and mix, and knock oﬀ each other&#x2019;s rough edges, criticize each
other, exchange disparate viewpoints, spar — and that is the basis of civil society. We
summarize all of our agreed codes of conduct as The Law, and we serve it to the
Police to enforce. If you don&#x2019;t keep stirring the colloid, it splits up into globules again
and the police forces of the world are just ﬂoating around in the carrier liquid, unable
to penetrate the globules.. Society has been splitting up into a tribal globules for
several years now, because we do not meet each other in the same way as
before.”
</p><!--l. 3189--><p class="indent" >  “Because of mobiles? You think that is really true?”
</p><!--l. 3191--><p class="indent" >  “I know it. Even when we meet in public, we are really somewhere else, talking to
someone on the end of a little armoured communications pipe that no one can listen
to. No one can interrupt us, edit us, and say—hey, you&#x2019;re full of shit. People do not
police one another any more, because of the sheer volume of communication. Police
forces are on the defensive, whereas society demands a kind of oﬀensive
moderation.”
</p><!--l. 3200--><p class="indent" >  He shrugs. “I don&#x2019;t get it.”
</p><!--l. 3202--><p class="indent" >  Bishop becomes suddenly stern. “Society is breaking up, Dermot. The world
over. It is worst in the U.S., but we see it happening here too. The police
forces of the world are there to enforce a social consensus, a set of laws that
summarize our basic tenets of society. But that law has to reﬂect the opinions
of the majority, otherwise it cannot be enforced. People are creating their
own splinter groups, with their own laws. That&#x2019;s great news for organized
crime. It is great news for corruption. It is bad news for social stability and
democracy.”
</p><!--l. 3212--><p class="indent" >  “Isn&#x2019;t it more democracy? I mean if people do more like they want to?”
</p><!--l. 3214--><p class="indent" >  “No, that is libertarianism, or anarchy even. In a democracy, you agree to disagree,
and then you abide by the majority&#x2019;s wishes.”
</p><!--l. 3217--><p class="indent" >  Dermot shifts uncomfortably now. “So I joined the crime team because I was
interested in the security of commercial services in the game. I am not sure
what you are telling me now. It sounds kind of like disaster scenario science

ﬁction.”
</p><!--l. 3222--><p class="indent" >  Bishop stares at him for a moment as if marshalling his thoughts. Dermot cannot
quite look him in the eyes. Wide penetrating eyes, full of worry. Norwegian
eyes.
</p><!--l. 3226--><p class="indent" >  He looks at the stairwell beside them, to avoid them; rose patterns swirl in the
iron-work of the spiral steps. Details. They say that God – or was it the devil? – is in
those details.
</p><!--l. 3230--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, you did,” Bishop says ﬁnally, as if picking a new strategy. “But what I am
asking you to do is to step back from that for a moment and see something bigger that
is going on, under the obvious surface. Forget about the superﬁcial mechanics of your
job, and get philosophical for a moment. That is my job.” He laughs ironically. “I
suppose police forces are not famous for being philosophical. But we have had to
adapt these last ten years.”
</p><!--l. 3237--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah.”
</p><!--l. 3239--><p class="indent" >  “Do you know that we started university training and research, to try to get to grips
with the changes? That was years ago. That&#x2019;s my job – or how it started. I don&#x2019;t think
too many people know how the police works. You can&#x2019;t make a TV show about our
work, so no one has been fed a romanticized version. Don&#x2019;t be confused. We are just
regular police—nothing covert or underhanded. But the world&#x2019;s police forces have
come to the understanding that we have to change our modus operandi somewhat. The
distinction between crime and normal behaviour is being eroded. We need to think
again.”
</p><!--l. 3249--><p class="indent" >  “It sounds kind of scary.”
</p><!--l. 3251--><p class="indent" >  “And it is. Trust me. It is.”
</p><!--l. 3253--><p class="indent" >  They look at each other for a moment in silence, as if examining one another for
signs that this is all some kind of joke. Has someone at the department put
Bishop up to this? Will the hidden cameras suddenly appear, amidst a lot of
forced laughter? Well, Mr. Macguire-Olsen, we have murdered your family on
national television, but it was all in the best possible fun—and the ratings were
excellent. So now we should all laugh about it, in the name of television
entertainment.
</p><!--l. 3261--><p class="indent" >  Or is this a rite of passage for him working with the crime team? A ritual
humiliation? A test? Entry to the Freemasons? Dermot feels as though his head is
spinning.
</p><!--l. 3265--><p class="indent" >  The waitress returns with a tray and begins to unload their goods. The
timing is good; Dermot uses the opportunity to get a reality check. Bishop
arranges his coﬀee and cake on the table in front of him, but does not touch
them.
</p><!--l. 3270--><p class="indent" >  “So,” Bishop says. “All right. Let me put it this way. You must have seen the rioting
and unrest in the United States in the news?”
</p><!--l. 3273--><p class="indent" >  He nods. “Yes.”
</p><!--l. 3275--><p class="indent" >  “Good. Well, the media is telling us that this is all very unexpected and radical.
What do you think?”

</p><!--l. 3278--><p class="indent" >  Dermot shrugs.
</p><!--l. 3280--><p class="indent" >  “I am suggesting to you that this is not all that unexpected. The Wilkinson report
predicted this kind of social breakdown some time ago. There is a loss of
governmental authority, and therefore a loss of the authority that goes with the
institutions of state; the law courts, the police, and so on. It is worst in the U.S.,
because American corporate culture has long been the driving force for its politics
there. America&#x2019;s ruling class is basically a conglomeration of multi-national,
rich people who have their own agendas. They were further along the path
than anyone else. But we are not far behind them. This is an outgrowth of
that.
</p><!--l. 3291--><p class="indent" >  “What makes it unsavoury to them is that mobile communications have moved
power back to the little guy. You no longer have to be rich to be powerful to be in
control, you just need to be well connected to your target audience.”
</p><!--l. 3296--><p class="indent" >  “Everyone has a mobile,” Dermot adds absently.
</p><!--l. 3298--><p class="indent" >  “And everyone has their own private chat rooms, with encrypted channels that even
the N.S.A. or G.C.H.Q. cannot crack in real-time.”
</p><!--l. 3301--><p class="indent" >  “And there is no mixing in these private rooms.”
</p><!--l. 3303--><p class="indent" >  “Yes! Exactly!” Bishop seems elated that Dermot has passed his little intelligence
test. “Not only that, but the currency of the little guy is not money. He or she speaks a
diﬀerent language. Other things are important. This is all very disturbing to the
political big-cats, who have their own traditions. The governments and so on. Even
when there has been corporate corruption in the past, there has been enough
consensus in society to hold the governmental power base of these rich people and
keep the country together, because the basic illusion was focused around a single
centre of power. But as time goes on there is a fragmentation from the grass roots
level. In the U.S. you have the Bible Belt and the East coast and the West coast and
the Riﬂe Association and . . . you name it. Every little group with its own agenda is
asserting its independence. Every group, that does not see its personal hobby-horse
being represented by traditional society at large, is looking for a piece of the
action.”
</p><!--l. 3319--><p class="indent" >  Dermot begins to see his point. “I think this is just a classic management
problem. I mean, it&#x2019;s just like computers, isn&#x2019;t it? When you decentralize your
system, you have to accept a diﬀerent kind of uncertainty in the model. Society
has to agree on a common operating system in order to integrate into one
big computer program. You are saying that people are choosing their own
operating systems that are not compatible, so it is becoming hard to manage the
diversity.”
</p><!--l. 3327--><p class="indent" >  Bishop smiles. “Yes, I suppose that is a fair analogy. You are the computer expert.
That&#x2019;s why I need you.”
</p><!--l. 3330--><p class="indent" >  “So it seems to me that you have two choices.”
</p><!--l. 3332--><p class="indent" >  “Go on.”
</p><!--l. 3334--><p class="indent" >  “Either you split up society into distributed pieces, with local autonomy and weak
cooperation with a few ties, or you ﬁght to win back integration with centralized

management.”
</p><!--l. 3338--><p class="indent" >  “Yes.” Bishop seems pleased. “We can make every little group into a virtual
country, with its own laws and customs. That is ﬁne in the virtual world, but we
cannot forget about the good old-fashioned physical world. There is still the matter of
the law. What is its role now? Surely even computers have to agree on some common
rules of play when they share public spaces?”
</p><!--l. 3345--><p class="indent" >  Dermot nods, slowly, tuning into the idea now that he can put it into a framework
that he understands. “That&#x2019;s true. There are protocols that handle that kind of
thing.”
</p><!--l. 3349--><p class="indent" >  “Good. Protocol sounds like something that I can understand. But are these
protocols cooperative or aggressive in nature? Do people end up in civil society, or in
mortal combat?”
</p><!--l. 3353--><p class="indent" >  Dermot nods to show his understanding of the question.
</p><!--l. 3355--><p class="indent" >  “And what are the police forces to do? Are they part of this protocol? Whose
rules should they follow? In a sense, they are following an outdated set of
ideals. They stand for the old centralized power model, where rich people
decide what is right and wrong—in other words, what others are rebelling
against.”
</p><!--l. 3361--><p class="indent" >  “Same answer. Either you adapt, or ﬁght back.”
</p><!--l. 3363--><p class="indent" >  “Yes. But you know, it is actually becoming dangerous for law enforcement oﬃcers
to intervene. There is an increase in the amount of crime that is operating in these
closed globules. It is a kind of multi-maﬁa culture gone mad. Law enforcement only
works if people really want it to.”
</p><!--l. 3369--><p class="indent" >  Dermot takes hold of a paper napkin and chews his cheek. He looks back at Bishop
and takes a breath. “Ok. So everything is going to hell. What are our chances of
surviving before global warming kills us? Why are we here?”
</p><!--l. 3374--><p class="indent" >  Bishop nods and ﬁnally looks down at his prize. Dermot watches the man dig into
his piece of cake. The cake stands proudly as a dark brown wedge, like a ship&#x2019;s bow
breaking into a criss-cross wave pattern, made of some kind of coloured fruit puré. It
has a perfect sector form, almost too perfect to disturb. As he attacks it, it begins to
fall apart, leaving smears of chocolate on the plate, destroying the beauty of its virgin
birth.
</p><!--l. 3382--><p class="indent" >  “Why are we here?” Bishop repeats, with a mouth full of cake. “Hmmm! This is
good.” He chews more and swallows. Obviously, he is going to make him wait. “You
and I are here,” he says, “because of the Game.”
</p><!--l. 3387--><p class="indent" >  Dermot feels a twinge of relief at the mention of the Game. He was beginning to
think that he had lost contact with the real world. Perhaps he was dreaming. At least
the Game is something that he knows something about.
</p><!--l. 3391--><p class="indent" >  Bishop takes a sip of his coﬀee and summons himself. “All right. So society
is breaking into small pieces. Big government&#x2019;s days could be over. Why?
Because no one thinks they needs anyone else. The only thing they have to
exchange with people they don&#x2019;t like is money. How do you convince people
to get back together again? To regroup and fall into line, around common

ideals?”
</p><!--l. 3398--><p class="indent" >  Dermot shrugs, summoning no expression on his face.
</p><!--l. 3400--><p class="indent" >  “The Game is such an opportunity. It is actually a great idea. A shrewd move, you
might say. By people in former positions of power to consolidate that disintegrating
power.”
</p><!--l. 3404--><p class="indent" >  Dermot was half expecting something like this. He snorts. “I knew it couldn&#x2019;t be
just a game.”
</p><!--l. 3407--><p class="indent" >  “Well, yes it is a game, in one sense of the word. Just as it is a chat room and virtual
reality meeting place for multilingual cultures. But that is just what it is—not what it
is for.”
</p><!--l. 3411--><p class="indent" >  “And you are saying it has a purpose that goes beyond philanthropy.”
</p><!--l. 3413--><p class="indent" >  Bishop almost spits his coﬀee out. “Philanthropy!” He laughs. “I&#x2019;m sorry. I&#x2019;m
sorry. I don&#x2019;t mean to mock. I suppose it is good that you can still believe in such
things. I wish I could. Yes. I am saying it is not about philanthropy.”
</p><!--l. 3418--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s free for use, if you have the gear? It brings people together. Isn&#x2019;t that
philanthropy?”
</p><!--l. 3421--><p class="indent" >  Bishop nods, his eyebrows high, his eyes wide. “Oh sure, if free parking at the
shopping mall is philanthropy. To make the horse drink, you ﬁrst have to bring it to
water.”
</p><!--l. 3425--><p class="indent" >  “No, not a horse. You&#x2019;re saying it&#x2019;s a big spider&#x2019;s web for governments.”
</p><!--l. 3427--><p class="indent" >  “I like that!” Bishop laughs, and stuﬀs more cake into his mouth.
</p><!--l. 3429--><p class="indent" >  Dermot is with him now and is feeling more conﬁdent. “But what is it that
governments want the players to do in the game? There is not that much to do there
except engage in these fantasies, or in conversations, or in tourist trips around the
globe.”
</p><!--l. 3434--><p class="indent" >  “Propaganda.”
</p><!--l. 3436--><p class="indent" >  Dermot stops to think. “Propaganda?”
</p><!--l. 3438--><p class="indent" >  Bishop puts down his fork and washes down with a sip of coﬀee. “Society&#x2019;s
traditional law-givers are rebelling back. They are ﬁghting for their survival. If society
wants to regroup in a virtual world of private communication, they need to supply an
attractive reason to bring them together again. The game is not only such a
place. It is an environment over which the major investors have complete
control.
</p><!--l. 3445--><p class="indent" >  “Now you might say: why do we need governments? If we can get along ﬁne
without them. . . Well, there is the global economy which actually supports our society
far more than people realize. Countries are not independent anymore. Society has
specialized to the point at which small groups cannot be self-suﬃcient. People
actually need each other to survive. Could you grow enough food in your garden to
survive? I am guessing you wouldn&#x2019;t have a clue how to do it. You rely on
getting your food from a shop. The shop gets its produce from some market
garden in the Netherlands, or a dairy in Denmark. Our whole society is based
on the integration of specialization. It is too complex for any one person or
group to master each of the skills that is needed to survive. We are not like

the Amish. So, in fact, whether people know it or not—whether they like
it or not, they need each other. We cannot just abandon this infra-structure
that we have set up over thousands of years. Our lifestyle would collapse
eventually.”
</p><!--l. 3461--><p class="indent" >  “But, you make it sound like the world could end tomorrow. Surely this is a long
way oﬀ? We must be talking years, decades?”
</p><!--l. 3464--><p class="indent" >  “I doubt it. It is much easier to destroy something than it is to build it. All
you need to bring chaos to the world is to switch oﬀ the power for a week.
You will bring about wide scale disorder. If people don&#x2019;t have someone to
tell them what to do, many of them will perish or become violent. But we
digress.”
</p><!--l. 3470--><p class="indent" >  “Okay.”
</p><!--l. 3472--><p class="indent" >  “So the game is an opportunity. Rich people have been rich fortuitously, by virtue
of who they are, or by being in the right place at the right time. But society is
changing so that they are no longer seen as the icons of our society. So we are scaling
back to who-you-know relationships. The amount of complexity in society is
governed to a large extent by how much people are in communication. How
much they tell each other things, who they&#x2019;re talking to. But information has
reached a critical mass. Everything just looks like noise, so no one can see the
leaders and hence they look to smaller groups they can understand. Hence the
fragmentation.”
</p><!--l. 3483--><p class="indent" >  “Okay, so let&#x2019;s say I believe you. What about the game?”
</p><!--l. 3485--><p class="indent" >  “The game is meant to attract people into a place where they, once again, of their
own free will, can be bombarded by propaganda. The idea was originally proposed by
the U.S. government, but they realized quite soon that they could not do it without the
cooperation of others.”
</p><!--l. 3490--><p class="indent" >  “Typical. . .”
</p><!--l. 3492--><p class="indent" >  “You see, you cannot just have one country with a stable government. There is civil
society amongst humans, but there is also the society of nations and governments.
Cooperation is a very intertwined thing. If you want to be cynical about it, you could
say that the reason society works is that we all manage to brainwash each other into
the same mind-set.”
</p><!--l. 3499--><p class="indent" >  “That sounds pretty conspiratorial.”
</p><!--l. 3501--><p class="indent" >  “Not really. Only the way I have put it now. Societies have always been this
way. It doesn&#x2019;t really matter what the consensus is, as long as there is one.
Our whole world is based on the idea that we share the same illusions – or
delusions, if you like. But global communications mean that we meet each
other, like it or not, so we have better agree on the rules of engagement. On
morality. All of these mind-sets have to meet at the edges. The room for
multiplicity is shrinking, because we are increasingly dependent on one another&#x2019;s
specializations.”
</p><!--l. 3510--><p class="indent" >  “All right. So what can I do? What is it you want from me?”
</p><!--l. 3512--><p class="indent" >  “I want your help to understand how we can use the game&#x2019;s propaganda methods

ourselves. I want to know if it is possible to put something into the code of the game
that can help the police. The kind of little something that can change the very fabric of
society to ﬁght crime by changing people&#x2019;s attitudes again. You see, the game
consortium has one agenda which is to bring the world back under the wing of the
U.S. government and its corporate sponsors. But, while the strategy is smart, the idea
is morally corrupt. It is not law and order they want, but obedience, passive
obedience.”
</p><!--l. 3522--><p class="indent" >  “So you think the game is already corrupt.”
</p><!--l. 3524--><p class="indent" >  “Of course it is. All systems are corrupt.”
</p><!--l. 3526--><p class="indent" >  “Isn&#x2019;t that a pretty serious accusation?”
</p><!--l. 3528--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s too common to be serious. Dermot. But it is worth keeping an eye on. It&#x2019;s like
noticing there is mold on your cheese. As long as it is only a little, you don&#x2019;t
care—you expect it and it just tastes interesting. It is not until it starts to eat into the
bulk of the cheese that it becomes a problem.”
</p><!--l. 3534--><p class="indent" >  “I am not sure I like your view of the world,” Dermot mumbles, rubbing his eyes. “I
mean, I knew there was bad stuﬀ going on out there when I joined the crime team, but
this whole conspiracy, corruption thing. . .”
</p><!--l. 3538--><p class="indent" >  “The child pornography rings that your team investigates are just one tiny part of
what is going on. We work openly on that, because most people still agree that is a
pathology of our society. But it is only one ﬂavour of corruption.” He gestures up to
the rafters as if waving to the cherubs. “Corruption begins with little things: oh, you
know this is only a teeny little bending of the rules, it can&#x2019;t possibly matter to anyone.
Then gradually tolerance grows and the transgressions become bigger and bigger, like
your body learning to tolerate certain viruses and bacteria. All systems have
corruption, just as all organisms have disease, because it is a natural function of the
environment to test out every little rule of order that we try to enforce. It is a natural
body-function of society, if you like. That&#x2019;s why we have police forces and immune
systems.”
</p><!--l. 3552--><p class="indent" >  “But if everything is corrupt, what can we do?”
</p><!--l. 3554--><p class="indent" >  Bishop is relentless and goes back on the oﬀensive. “Suppose you want to root out
corruption in a system. How do you do it?”
</p><!--l. 3557--><p class="indent" >  Dermot does not bother to answer.
</p><!--l. 3559--><p class="indent" >  “You cannot report it to the authorities, because they are probably corrupt too. You
cannot tell your friend—he cannot do any more than you can. You have to be more
subtle. You have to change people&#x2019;s perceptions of their situation over time, so that
they do not know it is happening. It has to be subliminal, inescapable. Slowly people
have to start to believe that they always thought diﬀerently and that it is only their
stupid parents who were stuck in the past. It happens on the time scale of generations,
by persistent plugging. Take the environment as an example. Take genetic
modiﬁcations as an example. How do you steer those changes? Hire activist
groups?”
</p><!--l. 3570--><p class="indent" >  “Forgive me, I am somewhat tired.”
</p><!--l. 3572--><p class="indent" >  “Bear with me, Dermot. I want you to understand what we believe is going on in

the software you are investigating. We are talking about activism at the level of
governments, and we now are talking about counter-activism at the level of the police.
For the good of society.”
</p><!--l. 3578--><p class="indent" >  “Look, are you sure that you haven&#x2019;t confused me with someone else?”
</p><!--l. 3580--><p class="indent" >  “I am sure. This is my job. This is what I do.”
</p><!--l. 3582--><p class="indent" >  “But my task was just to look for hidden communication channels for child
pornography. It&#x2019;s part of the law here in Norway that software has to satisfy certain
ethical guidelines. . .”
</p><!--l. 3586--><p class="indent" >  “I understand all that,” he says, patiently. “What you need to understand is that
there are already powerful forces deployed to control people&#x2019;s ideas. The game&#x2019;s
war-zone tourism in Iraq is targeted at the American rural male audience. The sex
tourism of the Far East is aimed at central European males. The beauty pageants and
adventure scenarios are aimed at bored housewives. . . And then there is the religious
stuﬀ. You get the idea? ”
</p><!--l. 3594--><p class="indent" >  “I get it. I need to go home. Tell me what you want.”
</p><!--l. 3596--><p class="indent" >  He pauses, nods and pushes his chair back. “I&#x2019;ll tell you in a moment. First I have to
visit the washroom.”
</p><!--l. 3599--><p class="indent" >  Dermot expires a fatigued breath. “Go down to the other end, and it&#x2019;s down another
spiral staircase. You need to collect a key at the bar.”
</p><!--l. 3602--><p class="indent" >  Bishop purses his lips. “They run a tight ship here.”
</p><!--l. 3604--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s to keep the down-and-outs out of the washrooms.”
</p><!--l. 3606--><p class="indent" >  He looks out of the window as Bishop strides oﬀ. There are beggars all around
here. He knows that it is illegal to beg in Norway, but that has never stopped them
down here in the centre of town. Sad to see people like this, on the edge of society. Is
this what Bishop is talking about? Will society fragment so that everyone is on the
edge?
</p><!--l. 3612--><p class="indent" >  The café is starting to ﬁll up again, but in dribs and drabs; not like the
evening rush, still to come. Dermot is feeling warm now, and un-zips his
anorak.
</p><!--l. 3616--><p class="indent" >  What an enigma Bishop is. He has that Scandinavian look of reservation about him,
but an almost American self-conﬁdence. When he speaks, he talks as if he has know
all this for years. If that is the case, why hasn&#x2019;t anyone else heard about it? Or am I
just so out of touch, stuck in my work? And then there is the American accent. Why
would he be laying in to the U.S. if he comes from there? It takes several
minutes before Bishop comes back. His hands are wet and he has dirt under his
thumbnail.
</p><!--l. 3625--><p class="indent" >  “How are we doing?” Bishop asks. “Do we need more to drink?”
</p><!--l. 3627--><p class="indent" >  Dermot shakes his head, then remembers his manners. “No thank-you.” I have been
in Norway too long, he thinks. His mother would have shouted at him for such
Scandinavian contempt for manners.
</p><!--l. 3631--><p class="indent" >  “Ok.” He signals to the waitress for more coﬀee and seats himself again, almost
knocking his head on the spiral staircase. “So, Dermot, what do you think? Are you
interested in helping me? I really need your help.”

</p><!--l. 3636--><p class="indent" >  He looks Bishop in the eyes now. “I still don&#x2019;t know what it is I am supposed to do.
What you want me to do.”
</p><!--l. 3639--><p class="indent" >  Bishop grins. “Oh nothing much. Just change society – you know, as you do.” He
chuckles and Dermot smiles in spite of himself. “We need to look for patterns
ﬁrst. I have some unusual leads that I&#x2019;ll pass on to you tomorrow, but we can
leave the details for another time. I think we are both tired and it is good to
chat.”
</p><!--l. 3645--><p class="indent" >  No, Dermot thinks. You&#x2019;re not getting away with it that easily. “How do we change
society? How can I do anything? I don&#x2019;t even work for the game company
anymore.”
</p><!--l. 3649--><p class="indent" >  “Yes you do. You are on loan to us. You still have connections.”
</p><!--l. 3651--><p class="indent" >  “But I don&#x2019;t write the code anymore.”
</p><!--l. 3653--><p class="indent" >  Bishop stares at him, as if considering his strategy.
</p><!--l. 3655--><p class="indent" >  “All right. So we need to start a propaganda war of our own, on behalf of civil
society. And we need a strategy. I have some ideas on that which come from an
unusual source.”
</p><!--l. 3659--><p class="indent" >  Dermot lifts his eyebrows. “Okay.”
</p><!--l. 3661--><p class="indent" >  “But think, Dermot. What do you do with a society? You see those down and outs?”
He points out of the window, across the street to where a single man is sitting with a
paper cup. “What do you do to avoid people like this in society? What are we
doing wrong? Could we educate them better, to stop them from dropping
out? Is it genetic or memetic? Nature or nurture? What part of the inclusive
society has failed? Or, are we ﬂogging a dead horse? Perhaps it is too naive
to think that one single model of society can cover everyone&#x2019;s needs. So
should we perhaps segregate them entirely? How do you control undesirable
elements?”
</p><!--l. 3672--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ve never really thought about it.” Dermot ﬁnds the idea fascinating but is
somewhat uncomfortable not being able to contribute to the conversation.
</p><!--l. 3676--><p class="indent" >  “Suppose we try to ﬁx it by having two models. Is that then the same a
class based society? Is it immoral? Or a caste system that socialism has been
ﬁghting all these years? Or is this something entirely new in our society that has
never before existed—a product of our new technological, knowledge-based
lifestyle?”
</p><!--l. 3682--><p class="indent" >  “You mean like that <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Time Machine </span>H.G. Wells movie or <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Metropolis</span>?”
</p><!--l. 3684--><p class="indent" >  “The Morlocks and the Eloi, yes, you&#x2019;re right. That is a kind of segregation. South
Africa has a its own kind. The U.S. has had its kinds. The caste systems of India. . .
we have always had this kind of fragmentation. But I don&#x2019;t think that explains why
these down and outs have fallen mainly into the welcoming hands of an exploitive
chemical industry that&#x2019;s hell bent on milking them of their dignity. Opting
out of society is not the same as segregating it into classes. No, we need
something that makes people want to mix. Even castes mix, even if only to shovel
contempt at one another. They create a system that works, but it is not usually
democratic.”

</p><!--l. 3695--><p class="indent" >  “And you think we can change people&#x2019;s minds by serving them some kind of
go-help-your-country propaganda?”
</p><!--l. 3698--><p class="indent" >  Bishop laughs. “Did you know that the USIA and its children has been broadcasting
American propaganda for years? Actually, since the second world war. There is no
diﬀerence now, but it&#x2019;s just that a certain population of users is getting smart at ﬁnding
out stuﬀ independently using our modern information resources. When America
invaded Vietnam or Iraq, for instance, it was proactive defence. You can make
anything into anything else, just by messing with people&#x2019;s heads. It&#x2019;s all about the
information.”.
</p><!--l. 3707--><p class="indent" >  Bishop receives hot coﬀee and takes a sip.
</p><!--l. 3709--><p class="indent" >  “In your code, I think you will ﬁnd features that will allow the game consortium to
direct advertising content, but that is not what it is for. Advertising here is propaganda.
They might sell some of the space to commerce, but the main aim of the space is to
reintegrate the factions”
</p><!--l. 3714--><p class="indent" >  “I suppose it depends who pays for it and what they are saying.”
</p><!--l. 3716--><p class="indent" >  “Maybe. What interests me is how well propaganda works. And don&#x2019;t think that
you will always notice the obvious message. Suppose, for instance, I want to start a
conspiracy theory that implicates . . . say . . . the North Koreans or the Middle East in
something diabolical. Suppose I suggest that there is evidence that my father died of
toxins related to the genetically mutated species following the Chernobyl disaster.
How do I do it?”
</p><!--l. 3724--><p class="indent" >  Dermot shifts uncomfortably. “Why do I get the feeling that you already know the
answer?”
</p><!--l. 3727--><p class="indent" >  He smiles. “Well, I don&#x2019;t go to the newspapers and start making Weekly World
News headline allegations. I need to be more subtle.”
</p><!--l. 3730--><p class="indent" >  “You start a rumour. Get people talking about it.”
</p><!--l. 3732--><p class="indent" >  “Yes! That would be one way. Another way is to advertise.”
</p><!--l. 3734--><p class="indent" >  “Advertise?”
</p><!--l. 3736--><p class="indent" >  “Yes. Regular marketing. It sounds trite, but if you bombard a suﬃcient number of
people with suggestions often enough and in suﬃcient volume it will change their
basic belief system. That is what advertisers are trying to do all the time.
Vitamins in your shampoo, whiter-than-white antacid stuﬀ in chewing gum, you
know.
</p><!--l. 3742--><p class="indent" >  “This is all standard stuﬀ. Western propaganda does not work like the old
communist propaganda or the dictatorships in the Middle East. It&#x2019;s more subtle than
that. Until recently, at least, there has already been a culture of so much passivity and
consensus that you barely need to try to convince people any more. Keep them
fed, give them tele-entertainment and ﬁll them with unimportant sports and
lifestyle issues and they stop caring about anything else. So when it comes to
larger issues, everyone already has the same basic mind-set and you don&#x2019;t
have to try to get a consensus. You just tell people what they should think
and they are more or less happy to go alone with it. One or two folks are
going to develop and independent mind of their own – but they are minor

anomalies that can be ridiculed or taken out. This is how Western society
works.”
</p><!--l. 3756--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s what you meant about consensus.”
</p><!--l. 3758--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s what I meant. To create a society, we have to manufacture some kind of
consensus. In other words, that is what society was all about in the ﬁrst place: coming
together on a common agreement so that people can specialize and develop skills that
go beyond what anyone could aﬀord to do if he or she was not sheltered by a
group.”
</p><!--l. 3764--><p class="indent" >  “I though societies formed around religious worship.”
</p><!--l. 3766--><p class="indent" >  “Good point. But that is the purpose of religion, isn&#x2019;t it? It is a form of
mind-control for civil uniformity. It is a primitive form of politics that uses peoples&#x2019;
basic fears to manipulate them. Religion and spirituality are two diﬀerent
things.”
</p><!--l. 3771--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah, I always thought that too.”
</p><!--l. 3773--><p class="indent" >  “Then there is the counter belief that, if you leave peoples to themselves
they will gradually gravitate into masses of uniform opinion. Thing is, then
they have all fallen into the trap and you can start to manipulate them less
subtlety, to gain power, by changing the collective attitude to whatever you
please. People buy into the consensus because people do not want to stand
out.”
</p><!--l. 3780--><p class="indent" >  “Wait – there is no consensus in religion.”
</p><!--l. 3782--><p class="indent" >  “Of course there is. All religions play on the same basic fears. The fear of dying,
the fear of loneliness, of sickness. By joining the club, grief has been transformed to
fulﬁlment, loneliness to relief and even happiness. The wound of solitude has been
healed.”
</p><!--l. 3787--><p class="indent" >  What do you know about loneliness, Dermot thinks. He jibes, “Wow. This is what
religion does for you? Sounds good.”
</p><!--l. 3790--><p class="indent" >  “Religion is an all purpose monkey wrench, an adjustable spanner, a skeleton key
which pushes the right buttons and seems to replace the intended need with an
artiﬁcial one: a belief in an abstract love. It is the ultimate advertising slogan. Fill any
hole. We will make our product your solution, no matter what your weakness. We are
so damned good!”
</p><!--l. 3796--><p class="indent" >  “But it is present all over the world. There might be something to it.”
</p><!--l. 3798--><p class="indent" >  “Does it not tell you something that the distribution of religions in the world is
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">geographical</span>? No, Dermot. It spreads like a virus, just like any form of politics or
hearsay.”
</p><!--l. 3802--><p class="indent" >  “So is it a good thing or a bad thing, this control?”
</p><!--l. 3804--><p class="indent" >  “Ah, ﬁnally. This is the interesting question: the moral question. People are wired to
be social creatures. That means that we want to agree with our neighbours. We want to
homogenize. That is the key weapon that allows us to be manipulated by the righteous
and the ruthless. So, yes, we want to belong to a group, but we also want to belong to
a safe group that places the needs of the many before the needs of a few rich
executives, or extremists.”

</p><!--l. 3812--><p class="indent" >  “And what does the crime team do about it?”
</p><!--l. 3814--><p class="indent" >  “We follow the development of the prevalent dogmas now. They are usually
associated closely with organized crime and exploitation. Some with religion, and the
above. . . But it is all getting much worse, and we are falling behind. There are more
competing ‘religions&#x2019; than ever.”
</p><!--l. 3820--><p class="indent" >  “Maybe that is good – you know like keeping lots of the bacteria in your stomach
healthy to prevent the ulcer variety from growing too powerful.”
</p><!--l. 3823--><p class="indent" >  Bishop laughs drily. “I like it. That is one way of looking at it. Unfortunately, those
who are most malignant will tend to dominate. But don&#x2019;t get me wrong, there are
plenty of powerful messages from the law too. As a police force, it is not our job to
decide which are right or wrong, only which are counter to society, or which
foster crime. But we see the need for a counter-strike on the the propaganda
front.”
</p><!--l. 3831--><p class="indent" >  Dermot nods.
</p><!--l. 3833--><p class="indent" >  “The project you are working on is part of the indoctrination introduced by the U.S.
and other governments to consolidate its control over society, but it is now under
attack. It was only a matter of time, of course. The economic model does not always
lead to quality. . .only competition.”
</p><!--l. 3839--><p class="indent" >  “You lost me,” he grumbles.
</p><!--l. 3841--><p class="indent" >  “The contract was sold to a number of contractors, but the tendrils of corruption
go deep. Evangelist churches in the U.S. see the spread of this game as an
opportunity to hijack the indoctrination process for their own aims. America
is really a test case. It is a prime example of what happens when a culture
dumbs down in a process of fear and dependency over generations. Everything
becomes simplistic. The media has a simple edge detection algorithm that turns
things into black and white and the kids in schools are taught how to toe the
line. It is an authoritarian culture and a culture of propaganda. They eat it
up.
</p><!--l. 3852--><p class="indent" >  “The churches are pretty annoyed, you see, that secular politics has all but stripped
them of their power over the years, so they have been formulating strategies to win in
politics for a long time. Who owns the most land, the most wealth? Who takes ten
percent of your income? It&#x2019;s a cynical ploy to buy your politics, by playing it at its
own game.
</p><!--l. 3858--><p class="indent" >  “We have received a warning from the F.B.I. about the possibility that they will be
setting up here too. There is a Christian South here too, although Norway has less of a
missionary reputation. The evangelists see that religion is threatened, even in the U.S.,
by a propaganda medium that they have not conquered. That could see the end of
several very powerful and rich empires. They are looking at ways of ﬁghting
back.”
</p><!--l. 3866--><p class="indent" >  Dermot is not sure whether he is annoyed now or simply exhausted. “So again.
Why me? How can I help you?”
</p><!--l. 3869--><p class="indent" >  “According to my information, you are the one who works on these technologies
here. I think you can help me to plant the information I need in the public

consciousness. The short of it, Dermot, is that I need to counter-hijack this psyop
pathogen.”

<!--l. 3878--><p class="indent" >  Autumnal hues are splashed onto the trees; limp yellow leaves fall along with the
drops of rain splattering onto his umbrella. Dark brooding hangs in the sky, as he
walks into a suddenly altered unknown.
</p><!--l. 3882--><p class="indent" >  Dermot paces solemnly back towards the tram station, his mind spinning and
over-full with things to think about. Does he really believe what he has heard? Does
he care? Shouldn&#x2019;t it be someone else&#x2019;s job to ﬁgure this out? <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I am just a programmer.</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">. .</span>
</p><!--l. 3887--><p class="indent" >  A skinny girl, in her mid twenties perhaps, is standing there waiting too. She has a
short black skirt and a smart jacket, and shoulder length blond hair. She glances at him
shyly. Her thin features are neither old nor young. He guesses that she must be twenty
something, but who knows? She smiles shyly at him and he smiles back.
Dermot has never been very good with girls, but he knows one when he sees
one. And she really is one. He is not shy, but he is bashful. He ﬁnds himself
aroused.
</p><!--l. 3896--><p class="indent" >  He recalls the ease with which Bishop had struck up a conversation. Just look
unaﬀected and say the words, he thinks. “So when do these trams go anyway?” he
says, as matter of factly as he can.
</p><!--l. 3900--><p class="indent" >  She just smiles.
</p><!--l. 3902--><p class="indent" >  “Do you have the time?”
</p><!--l. 3904--><p class="indent" >  “Sorry.”
</p><!--l. 3906--><p class="indent" >  He stands there in the rain, watching the drops splash on the pavement. Nearby he
can hear soft ambient song echoing from a jazz cafe, contrasting with the proximity of
the thudding pellets. It is all vanishing now, slipping away. The whole meeting is
dissolving into the reality of those hammering drops. He ﬁnds himself suﬀused by a
melancholy and his eyes are drawn to the girl&#x2019;s slight ﬁgure. She seems more
important to him at this moment.
</p><!--l. 3914--><p class="indent" >  A rumbling caterpillar tram thunders around the corner, squeaking on its tracks, as
the lights change to green; it stops in front of them. Doors whoosh neatly open,
ejecting outwards and sideways, like a space capsule, and bid them entry into a
crowded chassis. There is only one double seat left. He sits down next to the girl,
looking down at her skinny legs, black tights, short skirt. Damn. What dream is he
wrestling with now?
</p><!--l. 3922--><p class="indent" >  The train rumbles through the town, shoving them from side to side, as it is
clumsily forced to alter direction by the bumps and imperfections in the track, and
thoughts abandon him. All he can see now is her blond hair and small hands as they

fumble with an old mobile handset. Something about her is special. There are
beautiful girls everywhere, but she has a quality that attracts him. An undeﬁnable
fragility. A calmness. Something else?
</p><!--l. 3930--><p class="indent" >  Several stops. He is nearing his destination. He has to say something. The eﬀort is
excruciating and results in more of a squeak than an inquiry.
</p><!--l. 3934--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s a classic,” he blurts.
</p><!--l. 3936--><p class="indent" >  “What?” she snaps. Nervous wide, Scandinavian eyes, full of terror. She knows that
he has been looking at her. She must be sure that he is a creep.
</p><!--l. 3940--><p class="indent" >  “Your mobile. I haven&#x2019;t seen one like that for years.”
</p><!--l. 3942--><p class="indent" >  “Oh.” Her voice softens. “It&#x2019;s my brother&#x2019;s.” Then, as an afterthought: “Are you into
computers?”
</p><!--l. 3945--><p class="indent" >  “Eh . . . yes,” he half-stammers, taken aback.
</p><!--l. 3947--><p class="indent" >  She nods with the outline of a smile.
</p><!--l. 3949--><p class="indent" >  He fumbles in his pocket and pulls out a paper card with his name and
position on it: a gimmick from his old company. She takes it as though it is
something dirty, ﬁngering it as though she does not really know what it is
for.
</p><!--l. 3954--><p class="indent" >  “Dermot,” she reads. “That&#x2019;s you.” It is not really a question, but he has to
say yes. “I haven&#x2019;t seen one of these for a long time.” She closes her palm
with the card in it, as if to say: this is unimportant, but I am going to keep it
anyway.
</p><!--l. 3959--><p class="indent" >  Normally people ask him about his name. What kind of a name is that? Dermot?
But not her. She seems to accept it without question. He likes that. It makes her seem
experienced and intelligent. She does not say another word.
</p><!--l. 3964--><p class="indent" >  The tram comes to a stop.
</p><!--l. 3966--><p class="indent" >  “Well, anyway. Nice to meet you.”
</p><!--l. 3968--><p class="indent" >  The girl smiles without looking his way and says nothing.
</p><!--l. 3970--><p class="indent" >  He ﬂees the tram, stepping back out into the rain and starts oﬀ towards his
apartment. That&#x2019;s about as far as he ever gets with women.

</p><!--l. 4033--><p class="indent" >  Sunday morning. Den sees the ﬂimsy houses they build in this part of California as
he drives past the residential lot. They seem like cardboard shanty towns, scarcely
strong enough to withstand a sea breeze let alone an earthquake. Do they get
earthquakes down here? Decent middle class people live here but why in such rag
tag accommodation? It is the merest veneer of order on top of the desert
chaos.
</p><!--l. 4041--><p class="indent" >  As he looks at these houses, he thinks of the security of his London oﬃce block, its
grand entrance exuding authority and substance. Here the power lines seem to be hung
up like washing lines in the shanty commune, haphazardly hooked over poles that
look like shaven cacti and pass through crumbling plaster into these shacks. He
can see the obscene trappings of reality intruding forth into this would-be
civilization, like a broken bone penetrating the skin. This is not like the slick
malls and corporate cathedrals he is used to. Perhaps he is spoiled? What if it
is really this way everywhere, just beneath the surface—even in the aging
dereliction of old London town. He has never really considered it before,
how the perfect marble foyer creates such stature and grace, such triumphant
authority over the natural world. How deep does the illusion really go? he
wonders.
</p><!--l. 4056--><p class="indent" >  As he drives out of the city, around the curving roads, he sees the families
gathering at the coﬀee houses. At one time, Sunday was a day when people
probably went to Church in most parts of the Christian world. Then there
was a time when Sunday was for washing your car. Now we have reached
the age of going out for Sunday coﬀee, he thinks. It is useful to see these
trends. They are partly a testament to the work that his branch of industry has
fostered.
</p><!--l. 4064--><p class="indent" >  Sirens sound far oﬀ. There is a commotion ahead on the freeway. Some police are
already here. He slows down to match the rest of the traﬃc and begins to see several
police cars at the side of the freeway already. A group of activists seems to have taken

over a huge advertising billboard and have done something to it. It does not seem to be
showing video properly in real time anymore. Den slows down even more to
look closely. The billboard seems to be showing a political advertisement for
the upcoming elections. The ﬁlm is some kind of sales campaign for the
Democrat candidate, but the image on the board seems to be getting stuck in
certain frames. It begins in bursts, showing the overly made-up face of what is
presumably the candidate for the election – Den cannot honestly say that
he has seen this man before, nor does he much care. He has learned that
some of these billboards can break into the car sound system as it passes.
Luckily for him, he has turned oﬀ the radio altogether, or he would doubtless
be assailed by some of this nonsense. His lip curls at the irony of his own
intolerance of this kind of advertising. Well, you don&#x2019;t have to like it to make
it.
</p><!--l. 4084--><p class="indent" >  He thinks back to the pleasant afternoon he spent with Cathy Kim, and how they
ended up in his bed.
</p><!--l. 4090--><p class="indent" >  Suddenly the image is gone and a slogan appears prominently but looking not
unlike a frame in the actual video sequence. The frame contains a slogan:
WEISSKOPF MAKES CHILD PORNOGRAPHY. Some more of the ﬁlm runs and
then another: WEISSKOPF IS UN-AMERICAN. Then another: WEISSKOPF
THINKS HE&#x2019;S INTELLECTUAL. And so it seems to repeat.
</p><!--l. 4097--><p class="indent" >  Den is a little curious but it takes a moment for him to see what is going on. It looks
like some kind of smear campaign. But are these activists responsible or are they
just exposing the subliminal content that someone else has planted in the
ads?
</p><!--l. 4102--><p class="indent" >  Some international news channels are here on the scene already. That seems strange
in itself, since the police seem to be doing their best to shut this down quickly.
Perhaps this was staged.
</p><!--l. 4106--><p class="indent" >  The traﬃc is slowing down and moving into single ﬁle. His mind wanders to the
work he did on political advertising in the U.K. a couple of years earlier.
It seems a far cry from this. A police man waves him past, staring at the
line of traﬃc with impenetrable black glasses. Den does not look back, but
ﬁles past and follows the traﬃc into a line that is bound for the next exit. He
follows the ramp as it curves up and around and directs him away from the
traﬃc. After a short spell on this residential looking road, he ﬁnds the turn he
needs.
</p><!--l. 4116--><p class="indent" >  Finally he is oﬀ the freeway and onto the narrow road that leads towards to hills. It
is narrow but straight and it ﬁlls him with a sense of release, as if this narrow
constraint on his driving were somehow a new found freedom. He puts his foot down
on the gas, the only freedom left to him, and enjoys the simple sense of power that the
acceleration gives.
</p><!--l. 4123--><p class="indent" >  As he approaches the forested hills, the road begins to wind around a river and then
begins to enter a series of bends to ascend. He has to slow at the ﬁrst of the
sharper bends and notices that the road quality is deteriorating. Den curses the

sluggishness of the car and shifts the gear stick into terrain mode. He loathes the
automation of this rental. Soon they will automate the steering of these cars
too and then there will be little room for drivers. Probably a road like this
would cause cars of the future to simply stop and deny the possibility of
coping.
</p><!--l. 4134--><p class="indent" >  He drives up the swinging road to the chateau in the open top convertible. He
enjoys navigating these switchback hairpin bends. They illuminate his spirit with an
invigorating sense that he still matters to the driving process. This is the life, he thinks.
The complete mastery of a simple challenge.
</p><!--l. 4140--><p class="indent" >  He follows the winding road up the hill, passing a couple of residences hiding in the
trees along the way and feels it gradually ﬂatten out. As he reaches the crest there is
an open gate marked with the game logo. He steers into it and puts his foot down once
more for the last mile.
</p><!--l. 4146--><p class="indent" >  He reaches the main gate house and from there the small parking lot and cuts
through the cars to park almost in front of the house. Judging from the number of
vehicles, including several limo&#x2019;s, other guests have been arriving for some
time.
</p><!--l. 4151--><p class="indent" >  Den puts the roof up on the Cabriolet and uses the cover to check his appearance in
the car mirror. A Sunday brunch reception is a very American and very charming
touch, Den thinks as he brushes his dark suit. These meaningless functions are done
so well here. There are few vestiges in Europe that take themselves seriously enough
for such formal occasions. Too bad.
</p><!--l. 4158--><p class="indent" >  Den gathers himself and steps out of the car. There is a feint smell of smoke in the
air, perhaps a barbecue. He trots up the steps and is greeted by a doorman who checks
his ID and dispatches him into the lounge area.
</p><!--l. 4163--><p class="indent" >  The room is impressive. With only a little daylight ﬁltering into the welcome
lounge, the lighting is subdued, allowing candle light to work its charms and
welcoming an air of expectation. The date must be approaching Halloween, Den
thinks, as the room has been ﬁlled with carved pumpkin heads with candles ﬂickering
inside them. But it is only mid-October. Well why not? Christmas, after all, starts in
November these days.
</p><!--l. 4170--><p class="indent" >  Tables of canopés are laid out on silver trays with cakes and drinks multiplying at
the hands of smartly dressed Latin waiters. A mighty ﬁsh, frozen in the moment of
capture, spews nuts and vegetables from its gape. People are already helping
themselves to the food. There is perhaps a hundred persons in this social pin ball
game.
</p><!--l. 4177--><p class="indent" >  Den wanders in, wondering how long it will take to ﬁnd someone plausible to speak
to. These dinner parties are always exceedingly dull. No one really knows what to say
to anyone else. Still, these dos are good places for networking and that is what he has
come here to do; on the other hand, some of the company at these things can be
intolerably dull. Most of the chit-chat has nothing at all to do with the group that is
here. He picks up a glass of champagne-like bubbles and sips at it, surveying the
scene.

</p><!--l. 4186--><p class="indent" >  He strolls, as casually as he can, into to the lounge, observing the silhouettes of
small groups that have already arrived against the huge garden windows. He sees a
tall, broad man, who seems to stand out from the rest for his sheer dimensions. “Social
structure emerged when we left the egalitarian hunter-gatherer life for organized
agriculture,” he is saying. “It is a development that is hard to reverse. It has pushed
us out onto an evolutionary ledge. It we don&#x2019;t learn how to ﬂy, we have to
perish.”
</p><!--l. 4195--><p class="indent" >  A woman who is staring at him with an almost annoyed intensity, interjects, “So,
you think that society is a time-bomb? That we are not really adapted to make it
work? I mean, not fully?”
</p><!--l. 4199--><p class="indent" >  “That could be true,” he admits. “Certainly, we are far from perfect. For
one thing, our intelligence gives us basically anti-social behaviour. Look
at the insects: <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">they </span>are adapted to life in society. We have too many selﬁsh
qualities.”
</p><!--l. 4204--><p class="indent" >  “Yes,” says another man, “but our human intelligence is what made us gravitate
more socially together in the ﬁrst place. Our need for grooming? Or do you disagree
with that theory?”
</p><!--l. 4208--><p class="indent" >  “Well,” says the woman, “that has a basis in truth, but our intelligence arose
because of the complexity of the relationship between those in the group.
Competition, particularly in sexual selection is not the same as cooperation.
The arms race of intelligence is a result of psychological warfare, not of
peace.”
</p><!--l. 4214--><p class="indent" >  A short woman, who is more smartly dressed than the others adds, “So
do you think evolution will ever change us to make us more conducive to
society?”
</p><!--l. 4218--><p class="indent" >  “Well,” laughs the second man, “natural selection has been all but eliminated in the
West. If a new phase of mankind is to emerge, it would have to be in the third world.
But that does not seem very likely. The changes would have to be small. We are too
eﬀective at changing the environment. The environment no longer changes us.” They
all laugh.
</p><!--l. 4225--><p class="indent" >  “My God, can we allow it?” says a voice to his left. Den is startled and
focuses on a man in military uniform. He does not recognize the man but he
smiles congenially at him and raises his glass of champagne and his eyebrows
together.
</p><!--l. 4230--><p class="indent" >  “You gave a great talk yesterday—Morris, don&#x2019;t you think?”
</p><!--l. 4232--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s right . . ..” Den extends his hand, changing glass-hand humbly.
</p><!--l. 4234--><p class="indent" >  “Cedric Hopkins—General Hopkins, by habit.” He smiles. “I think you convinced
us all that what we are doing is a force for good. Certainly I think of my grandchildren
moving into a better world, where we can all feel safe from the noise of information
trash and where crime is a thing of the past.”
</p><!--l. 4240--><p class="indent" >  “It would be nice to think that could happen. Perhaps I over-sold it a little,” he
laughs.
</p><!--l. 4243--><p class="indent" >  “Oh, don&#x2019;t sell yourself short, son. You did such a good job on everything

else.”
</p><!--l. 4246--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I did my best.”
</p><!--l. 4248--><p class="indent" >  “You just arrive? Got yourself something to eat?”
</p><!--l. 4250--><p class="indent" >  “Oh, yes. I just got here. I can wait a minute for food. I was just trying to get my
bearings.”
</p><!--l. 4253--><p class="indent" >  “You&#x2019;ve been to these things before?”
</p><!--l. 4255--><p class="indent" >  “Once before,” Den admits. “A year or so ago, we had a similar get-together, but
without all the press attention—and far fewer people.”
</p><!--l. 4259--><p class="indent" >  “I see. So you&#x2019;ve been spoiled by our taxpayers before then.” He winks.
</p><!--l. 4261--><p class="indent" >  Another man sees the general and comes over to them. “General,” he acknowledges
and shakes the General&#x2019;s hand. “And . . . ah, I think I recognize you. You gave the talk
at the conference?”
</p><!--l. 4265--><p class="indent" >  “Den Morris. Guilty.” They shake hands perfunctorily.
</p><!--l. 4267--><p class="indent" >  “Colin Frank. I&#x2019;m just a friend of the General here, and an investor.” He smiles.
“You know—more money than sense.” he laughs again.
</p><!--l. 4270--><p class="indent" >  It is fascinating, Den thinks, how the old social rules of thumb work time and time
again. If you place an important ﬁgure in a crowd, he or she will accrete hangers-on
in a heartbeat. It is like a magical law of attraction. Fortunately, he thinks,
Americans have a natural congeniality about them in a neutral setting. It is easy
to get along with people. “So, General, what is your role in all this?” Den
asks.
</p><!--l. 4278--><p class="indent" >  “You mean: what am I doing at this pussy-assed brunch, full of egg-heads and
schemers?” He laughs heartily. “Well, I am happy to say that my primary motivation
is to eat some of the excellent food that I know will be served here today, as you
should too. It too often that we forget to appreciate these ﬁne things, when they are
laid out for us in the lap of luxury.”
</p><!--l. 4285--><p class="indent" >  “Sounds good to me!” Den say.
</p><!--l. 4287--><p class="indent" >  “Alas, some of the people here are too used to this life. You should put them all in
active duty sometime. When you spend time in the ﬁeld, you learn to survive on less
than ideal culinary achievements, shall we say.”
</p><!--l. 4292--><p class="indent" >  They laugh with him.
</p><!--l. 4294--><p class="indent" >  “Barring that, I hope to just get to know some of the ﬁne folks who have been
involved in this project. I am just a military man, but I like to think that I can
appreciate good work when I see it.”
</p><!--l. 4298--><p class="indent" >  “You are part of the project?”
</p><!--l. 4300--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I have been following it for some time. I am pretty much a desk job these
days, though don&#x2019;t say it too loudly. I try to keep up with what is going on in the
army&#x2019;s research programs.”
</p><!--l. 4304--><p class="indent" >  “So, General, do you think the game will have any beneﬁts, in a strategic
perspective? Do you think my investment will make be money?”
</p><!--l. 4308--><p class="indent" >  “I am sure it will.” He looks around him, as if scanning for someone. More people
are entering now. Another car must have arrived. “I actually have a friend, who said he
would make it here. He works for the space industry, you see.” He sticks his tongue

under the skin over his lip, as if trying to move something stuck in his teeth and
swallows. “Hmm. He tells me that you would be amazed at the bi-products that
emerge from any major project that is technologically challenging. You see, to make
these things happen, you have to involve so many creative minds and give them an
opportunity and a salary to do what they do best. Under conditions like that, great
minds do great things.”
</p><!--l. 4320--><p class="indent" >  “Most people would say that the space industry is a no brainer,” Frank mutters.
“There&#x2019;s not so many people standing in line to invest in that anymore.”
</p><!--l. 4324--><p class="indent" >  “Well, there is the voice of a cynic,” he laughs and stares at Den “You should be
wary of men with too much money. But then you are trained to deal with them, I
would think. You have the right weapons.”
</p><!--l. 4329--><p class="indent" >  Den laughs. “I&#x2019;ve heard that the space race did produce useful innovation.
Maybe even computers are a result of it: the very technology we are using
here.”
</p><!--l. 4333--><p class="indent" >  “No,” says the General. “Computers come from my turf. That would be bombs.
Bombs and planes.”
</p><!--l. 4336--><p class="indent" >  “Well, now we&#x2019;re talking more lucrative. Now you are getting me interested,” Frank
says. “Arms sales. Now there is a proﬁtable business.”
</p><!--l. 4340--><p class="indent" >  “Perhaps not for much longer, Colin. Isn&#x2019;t that part of the vision here?” He raises
eyebrows searchingly toward Den,
</p><!--l. 4343--><p class="indent" >  “As I understand it, yes.”
</p><!--l. 4345--><p class="indent" >  “Oh, come on,” Frank mocks. “You are not seriously telling me you believe our
own propaganda—that, by putting people into a safe environment where they all can
meet and play together, that you will promote peace and understanding.”
</p><!--l. 4350--><p class="indent" >  “Well, aside from putting a decent meal in their stomachs, that is a crude rendition
of a complex argument, but essentially correct. But not only that. By putting the
opportunity into the hands of American business and our allies, we are providing a
ﬁnancial incentive to turn entertainment dollars into a force for good. It will draw
people in, and they will love it. Before you know it, the beneﬁts are spreading out in
all directions!”
</p><!--l. 4358--><p class="indent" >  “I think the lodge is somewhat afraid of the idea, General.”
</p><!--l. 4360--><p class="indent" >  “Bahh, Colin, you should spend more time away from ﬁnancial sharks and get out
into the world.”
</p><!--l. 4363--><p class="indent" >  By now, the general has attracted more attention and, by standing in his wake, Den
has also been noticed. Several-passers by have nodded to him as he stood here. He
feels quite important now, and his posture has begun to elevate in keeping with his
new stature.
</p><!--l. 4368--><p class="indent" >  “Mr. Morris?” says a voice. It is Alfred Cooney, the man who has organized much
of the conference. “I would like you to meet someone special. Would you excuse us,
General?”
</p><!--l. 4372--><p class="indent" >  “But of course, take him away to some more interesting people!” He laughs again,
in a fatherly way. “Have fun, son.”
</p><!--l. 4375--><p class="indent" >  “Thank you, general. Perhaps we&#x2019;ll talk again later.”

</p><!--l. 4377--><p class="indent" >  Cooney leads Den away from the growing cloud towards a young man, perhaps of
his own age and a another perhaps in is forties. The ﬁrst has classically Jewish
features, short and plump, with balding ginger hair and freckles. He is badly dressed
in a light ﬂannel suit that looks as though it is ruined by sweat stains. “This
is Jim Moskewitz, from the department of marketing studies here in San
Diego.”
</p><!--l. 4384--><p class="indent" >  “Mr. Morris.”
</p><!--l. 4386--><p class="indent" >  “Call me Den.”
</p><!--l. 4388--><p class="indent" >  “And this is Jonathan Bradshaw from the University of Southern California. He has
been one of the instigators of the new anti-terrorism study bachelor study
program.” He is a skinny man, of about the same height, with thick black hair,
somewhat better dressed. Den has no idea what his ethnic background might
be.
</p><!--l. 4394--><p class="indent" >  “Hello. A study programme in anti-terror?”
</p><!--l. 4396--><p class="indent" >  “No less.”
</p><!--l. 4398--><p class="indent" >  “That sounds interesting.”
</p><!--l. 4400--><p class="indent" >  Bradshaw begins to describe the basic ideas of his course, as though it were a
pampered child prodigy being ﬂaunted before socially inferior parents. His tone
bursts with pride and arrogance, stemming from a total lack of self-doubt.
Even Den, master of himself, ﬁnds the man presumptuous and even boorish.
Some of the ideas are interesting, but his words simply seems to say: you
probably don&#x2019;t understand this but I&#x2019;ll feed you some scraps to be politely
condescending.
</p><!--l. 4408--><p class="indent" >  “But you are part of this meeting. What aspect of the game are you interested in?”
Den interjects, when he has reached his tolerance level.
</p><!--l. 4412--><p class="indent" >  “Oh, what aspects am I not interested in?” He waives loftily.
</p><!--l. 4414--><p class="indent" >  “Jonathan is a pretty dynamic kinda guy,” adds Moskewitz in apparently
genuine admiration. “He is an expert on pretty much anything you would like to
mention.”
</p><!--l. 4418--><p class="indent" >  Bradshaw does not protest.
</p><!--l. 4420--><p class="indent" >  “I can see that.”
</p><!--l. 4422--><p class="indent" >  Cooney says, “Den, I hear that you are one of the creative interpreters of the game.
perhaps you would tell me about just how you go about turning out mission objectives
into what the end user sees?”
</p><!--l. 4427--><p class="indent" >  “I am in charge of molding the team that does the real work,” Den replies calmly. “I
play a part in the process, but there are many others involved. It is really something
like the job of an architect, I think.”
</p><!--l. 4431--><p class="indent" >  “I have heard that your work is quite impressive.”
</p><!--l. 4433--><p class="indent" >  “Well, my team has been working with gaming for some time, doing proﬁling and
characterization, scenery, subliminal messaging and so on.”
</p><!--l. 4436--><p class="indent" >  “Directed imaging. That is what they call their mind-control tricks,” says Bradshaw.
“It&#x2019;s all part of the marketing parlance. The diﬀerent packages take a diﬀerent attitude
and undermine the opposing viewpoints.”

</p><!--l. 4441--><p class="indent" >  At that moment, a gong sounds and a voice calls for seating to begin in the main
dining hall.
</p><!--l. 4444--><p class="indent" >  “Ah, time to be seated, gentlemen. Why don&#x2019;t we move into the dining
area?”
</p><!--l. 4447--><p class="indent" >  Den takes the opportunity to wander away from the group he has been set up with.
He is wondering whether Cathy Kim is here, or if there is any other talent in
the room. So far he can only see well-to-do airbags, huﬃng and puﬃng at
the wolves in sheep clothing. Someone at a nearby table is complaining a
little too loudly. Den wonders how many welcome drinks he has already
consumed.
</p><!--l. 4454--><p class="indent" >  His entrance to the room is a moment of revelation for him. Several groups are
already seated and his appearance in the doorway is greeted with several glances and
smiles, as if people now recognize him. His performance at the public meeting must
have been a greater success than he has hoped for.
</p><!--l. 4460--><p class="indent" >  He begins to run through his routines for impressing people at dinner parties, a few
anecdotes for a suitable occasion, a menu of discussion topics to steer the
conversation without making him appear single-minded or boring.
</p><!--l. 4465--><p class="indent" >  A group sits down at the table beside him and one of the group greets
him.
</p><!--l. 4468--><p class="indent" >  “We enjoyed your talk,” he says. “Are you going to be doing more of the imaging?”
he asks. “I might be interested in an internship at your company, if you are hiring.” He
has a slightly camp, Latin accent and his features are possibly Mexican, Den
thinks.
</p><!--l. 4473--><p class="indent" >  “Well, we have no current plans. Who&#x2019; do you work for?”
</p><!--l. 4475--><p class="indent" >  “DiPix,” he utters, ﬂatly, with mock gravitas. “But don&#x2019;t hold that against
me.”
</p><!--l. 4477--><p class="indent" >  “Or tell him he has a beautiful body!” his friend laughs.
</p><!--l. 4479--><p class="indent" >  Den is looking for Kim; ﬁnally, he makes a sighting but he sees that she is led to
another table. Kim is speaking closely with an anonymous looking man with glasses.
She is wearing a black suit of smart synthetic looking material that is loose
enough to engage the imagination but tight enough to reward him with a
few hints of her astounding ﬁgure. She looks great, he thinks. He cannot
identify exactly what it is about her, but there is no doubt that she is both
attractive and alluring and he wants to see her some more before his visit is
over.
</p><!--l. 4489--><p class="indent" >  “Look, Den, why don&#x2019;t you join us here. Tell us some more about what you are
doing.”
</p><!--l. 4492--><p class="indent" >  Den sees that there is no space next to Kim, and the other tables around seem to be
ﬁlled in advance,. There is no particular alternative so he bites the bullet and says,
charmingly, “Thank you. That&#x2019;s kind.”
</p><!--l. 4496--><p class="indent" >  The brunch is served seated and Den ﬁnds himself trapped amongst these
programmers who liked his presentation. They are well meaning and friendly, but they
oﬀer him no opportunities for advancement. At best he might learn a little about his

competitors here; but, after his talk, that seems to be redundant. He is the
man of the hour and only needs to follow up on it. But there is still time
yet.
</p><!--l. 4503--><p class="indent" >  Some of the programmers have come down from their Los Angeles ﬁlm studios to
join the meeting. One could not come owing to an outbreak of forest ﬁre close to his
house. They seem to have mixed feelings about the project and begin to discuss
grievances that are not entirely appropriate for a brunch held in the lion&#x2019;s mouth
itself.
</p><!--l. 4509--><p class="indent" >  At least this is not a team of fully committed automata, he discovers. He will be
exposed to a little bout of honesty, a rare privilege in his line of business.
</p><!--l. 4513--><p class="indent" >  “Our goals are being changed at the last minute,” says one called Carlos. “We do all
this work on the characters and then we get a last minute spec change on the
concealments, sometimes even rendering details.”
</p><!--l. 4517--><p class="indent" >  A woman wearing a reporter badge, who works for the project, has joined them at
the table. She is young and pretty. Den smiles at her. “And you are?”
</p><!--l. 4521--><p class="indent" >  “Kay Bayley,” she says. “How do you do? I work for the press department.”
</p><!--l. 4524--><p class="indent" >  “How do you do” Den replies.
</p><!--l. 4526--><p class="indent" >  “It is hot where I came from”, she says, out of place, as she seats herself. “You must
be European?” Looking at Den.
</p><!--l. 4529--><p class="indent" >  He nods and shakes hands. “How hot is hot?”
</p><!--l. 4531--><p class="indent" >  “Oh—&#x2019;bout ninety Fahrenheit. I don&#x2019;t know what that is in that Celtic time y&#x2019;all use
over there.”
</p><!--l. 4534--><p class="indent" >  “Celsius,” Den nods.
</p><!--l. 4536--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t understand the jargon,” she says in a southern accent. “Do you mind if I ask
what y&#x2019;all are talking about?”
</p><!--l. 4540--><p class="indent" >  The Mexicans look sceptical but play along. One of them explains, “There are
several levels of actuality in the game,” he begins. “There are the high level goals
(called mission objectives), the interpretation of those goals (called concealment).
Then there is rendering of strategy and imagery, where Den is involved. Finally there
are the technical algorithms and resource economists.”
</p><!--l. 4547--><p class="indent" >  “I see.”
</p><!--l. 4549--><p class="indent" >  “Well, anyway, as I was saying. There is some strange shit going on. We have been
getting these ‘interventions&#x2019; from the contractor. Some of them have been on
government paper and shit. It&#x2019;s almost like these changes are coming directly from
some government agency.”
</p><!--l. 4554--><p class="indent" >  “What kinds of changes?” Den asks, vaguely interested in this gossip.
</p><!--l. 4556--><p class="indent" >  “You know, stuﬀ like moral parameters and facial changes to distinguish more
clearly between good characters and bad characters.”
</p><!--l. 4559--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah,” says another. “It&#x2019;s like all the good characters have to look like fucking
Disney drawings with the big sappy eyes, and all the bad guys have unshaven convict
faces.”
</p><!--l. 4563--><p class="indent" >  “And that&#x2019;s just the women!” the other chortles.
</p><!--l. 4565--><p class="indent" >  They laugh.

</p><!--l. 4567--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah, but no shit, man. This is weird. I mean, who are they kidding? I thought the
idea of the game was to have these complex characterizations, not this fucking cliché
shit.”
</p><!--l. 4571--><p class="indent" >  “Well I just think it is marvellous that this game is under the guiding hand of such a
great man as our president, chosen by God” she says with the kind of conviction that a
TV ad or tortured prisoner might redeem.
</p><!--l. 4576--><p class="indent" >  “Say what?” says one of the programmers rudely.
</p><!--l. 4578--><p class="indent" >  “The game is about the future of our youth. It seems only right that it should require
the highest standards of morality,” she recites.
</p><!--l. 4581--><p class="indent" >  Den&#x2019;s heart sinks as the others look at each other in hopelessness. She is an
attractive girl, with a pretty face and too much hair, but what she said makes her
suddenly as ugly as anyone he has ever seen. The attractiveness of her shell seems
only to compound the deceit.
</p><!--l. 4587--><p class="indent" >  As the discussion continues, frustrations begin to emerge amongst the guests. Den
follows the loosened tongues with interest. This could be signiﬁcant to his role in
what happens next. America is suﬀering from civil unrest in several states due to the
increasingly right wing detachment of the government, but the last place he expects to
hear this kind of open criticism is here.
</p><!--l. 4594--><p class="indent" >  The food servings seem to pass quickly. Den does not overindulge. He wants to be
in top form, but he eats a little to pass the time. This group is not exactly what he had
envisaged for today, but it is slightly interesting to him that some international
members of the team clearly feel left out of the enterprise. It is all very well that the
American directors want to be in control of the operation, but some freedom must be
relinquished if there is to be progress. There is a dark mist of foreboding thickening in
these conversations.
</p><!--l. 4603--><p class="indent" >  Why indeed should they be satisﬁed with the banner of a single media corporation&#x2019;s
logo when each brushstroke of the creative enterprise is an entity in itself?
The game is not just about technology, but about design, architecture, art
and drama. It is perhaps the greatest artistic undertaking in history. Why
should it be corrupted entirely for some multinational marionette for the US
government? Why should the eﬀorts of so many be subsumed by the proﬁts of so
few?
</p><!--l. 4611--><p class="indent" >  As they are served coﬀee, they are beginning to repeat themselves. “As things stand
today, the company is guilty of creative interference and moral embezzlement,” one of
them claims. “There should be a proper acknowledgement of the sources of ideas,
especially since the game would be an obvious vehicle of propaganda without our
concealments.”
</p><!--l. 4618--><p class="indent" >  “You mean as opposed to a subtle form of propaganda now.”
</p><!--l. 4620--><p class="indent" >  “Exactly. Sometimes I wonder if we are doing the right thing by working on this at
all.”
</p><!--l. 4623--><p class="indent" >  “My lord,” says the reporter girl, “Have you lost your way?”.
</p><!--l. 4625--><p class="indent" >  “Jesus, girl!”
</p><!--l. 4627--><p class="indent" >  “People are just not being treated properly, if you ask me. It&#x2019;s not just us, it&#x2019;s all

over the country. People are demonstrating in the streets for fuck sake, and still the
government is treating everyone like children.”
</p><!--l. 4632--><p class="indent" >  “Well, we have to trust the government to know what is right for the nation,” she
drones in her southern accent.
</p><!--l. 4635--><p class="indent" >  One of the programmers called Juan Pablo becomes irritated. “Lady, if you want
government bullshit blown in your cunt, that&#x2019;s ﬁne, but shit is going on here that
is not all it seems. Why don&#x2019;t your write that in your fucking propaganda
broadcasts.”
</p><!--l. 4640--><p class="indent" >  She blinks with an open jaw; the blow stings and she is apparently seeing stars in
the crockery. Several others from other tables have turned to stare.
</p><!--l. 4644--><p class="indent" >  At that moment a couple that has risen walks past Den saying, “The protest groups
believe that a skilled psyop team can inject actual attitudes and motivations into a
willing mind.” They look at Den as they pass and the man gestures towards him, as if
implicating him in this little conspiracy.
</p><!--l. 4650--><p class="indent" >  “How interesting,” says the man&#x2019;s apparent wife. “In what way?”
</p><!--l. 4652--><p class="indent" >  Den uses the opportunity to extricate himself from the table. “Would you excuse
me?” He rises and nods to the passers-by as if pretending to join them.
</p><!--l. 4656--><p class="indent" >  “This young man probably agrees with me, yes?” Den tries to look politely
surprised, as the man continues, unimpeded. “It is the ultimate form of saturation
teaching,” he says. “Eventually people&#x2019;s applied knowledge of the world will be
erased by the noise of mighty slogans. That is what communist and fascist regimes
have tried to do throughout history. Look at North Korea today and they are doing a
pretty god job. No longer do you just feed people Omega 3 to make them think
better—now you can more or less directly inject any idea straight into their brains by
targeting their favourite brain centre.”
</p><!--l. 4667--><p class="indent" >  “It must be very exciting work.”
</p><!--l. 4669--><p class="indent" >  “But do we fully believe it?”
</p><!--l. 4671--><p class="indent" >  “Look at the bible belt, for crying out loud! It has been going on successfully for
years!”
</p><!--l. 4674--><p class="indent" >  They make their way to the exit. Several tables are starting to leave the dining area
now, for the lounge beyond.
</p><!--l. 4678--><p class="indent" >  “But tell me,” the woman asks quite seriously, now looking at Den directly, “you
were talking about this in your speech. When do you think the human mind becomes
saturated? When do you think the noise of so many impulses becomes so great that a
person might actually go mad?”.
</p><!--l. 4684--><p class="indent" >  Den smiles uncomfortably and is saved from answering by another man who has
been hovering behind the couple, listen in in on their conversation.
</p><!--l. 4687--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t mind us wolves,” he says. “We are all harmless here, except for the folks
with the money. Can I get you a drink, Mr. Morris?” He oﬀers his hand in a manner
that seems to brush the couple aside; they glance at each other and continue on
alone.
</p><!--l. 4692--><p class="indent" >  Den adjusts his composure and asks: “And you are?”
</p><!--l. 4694--><p class="indent" >  The man steps forward, “Howard.” He oﬀers his hand. “I heard your speech. It was

good.” He stuﬀs his hands in his untidy sports jacket as if searching for something.
“Oh I&#x2019;m from the psychology advisory. I&#x2019;m not supposed to say more.” He
winks. His face is wrinkled with pocket of loose skin as though he has lost
weight.
</p><!--l. 4700--><p class="indent" >  The man picks at the back of his teeth as he speaks, as if to remove some piece of
food from them. “Uhmm. Consultant. Strategy.” He nods, as if agreeing with
himself.
</p><!--l. 4704--><p class="indent" >  Den tries to steer them towards the ﬁgure of Cathy Kim. She is standing with the
same man, still talking at length in a subdued way. She sees him now and seems to
jerk to attention, acknowledging him with her chin. The lounge is ﬁlling with bodies
now. Some glasses of dessert wine are circulating with waiters. Den takes
one.
</p><!--l. 4710--><p class="indent" >  “I am not sure I completely agree with your analysis, you know,” Howard
says.
</p><!--l. 4713--><p class="indent" >  Den looks at him calmly. “Well thank goodness for that,” he laughs, concealing his
uncertainty. “Everyone else seems so convinced; I was beginning to wonder if this
were all a dream.”
</p><!--l. 4717--><p class="indent" >  Howard laughs. “Ah, avoid conﬂict at any cost. It is easier to stab you in the back
once it is turned than to face you head on. But I don&#x2019;t have the social graces you
know.”
</p><!--l. 4721--><p class="indent" >  Den examines the man&#x2019;s grey looking pallor, wishing that he could escape what
seems to be an obvious trap. “So what is your angle—Howard?”
</p><!--l. 4725--><p class="indent" >  “Well”, he says. “Your summary of the work was ﬁne, but it is this business of
using the game to engage people. What was it you said? Something about getting kids
engaged in political and social issues by adding real-world context to the games. You
make it almost sound educational.”
</p><!--l. 4731--><p class="indent" >  “I think it is,” Den parries.
</p><!--l. 4733--><p class="indent" >  “Good. Then there is a chance that it might be. But I don&#x2019;t think you put the case
strongly enough. Have you ever thought of the possibilities for forming players&#x2019; basic
attitudes to learning through the game?”
</p><!--l. 4737--><p class="indent" >  “I am not sure I know what you mean.”
</p><!--l. 4739--><p class="indent" >  “I mean. . .” An elegant woman in a red dress taps him on the shoulder and hands
him something without interrupting. He acknowledges her and puts the small
object in his pocket. “I mean the subliminal signals and implicit cues that
are placed into the imagery.” She walks away, glancing only tangentially at
Den.
</p><!--l. 4745--><p class="indent" >  “Well, what makes you think there are subliminal signals?”
</p><!--l. 4747--><p class="indent" >  Howard laughs loudly. “Nice try, Den. Can I call you Den?!”
</p><!--l. 4749--><p class="indent" >  Den nods in amusement.
</p><!--l. 4751--><p class="indent" >  “Well—did you see the cuﬀuﬄe on the highway, coming here?”
</p><!--l. 4753--><p class="indent" >  “The billboard.”
</p><!--l. 4755--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, the billboard. An angry mob of people tired of being sent these subliminal
signals took over the electronics in order to reveal to all, in slow motion, just what the

billboard is really doing.”
</p><!--l. 4759--><p class="indent" >  Den snatches a glance behind him and sees that Cathy Kim has received
a call and is walking away from the lounge to talk. “Well, okay. We have
subliminal channels in our scenery. That is part of the spec. You must know
that.”
</p><!--l. 4764--><p class="indent" >  He nods. “Of course, but how is it being used?”
</p><!--l. 4766--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I don&#x2019;t know all of the content. My company works on certain things, and
helps to design the strategies for targeting interest groups.”
</p><!--l. 4769--><p class="indent" >  “But you have access to these channels. Channels that millions of people all over
the globe are using.”
</p><!--l. 4772--><p class="indent" >  “That is true,” he agrees.
</p><!--l. 4774--><p class="indent" >  “A position of great responsibility.”
</p><!--l. 4776--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, I suppose it is.”
</p><!--l. 4778--><p class="indent" >  “So, in fact, you have the skills to manipulate the manipulators, if you wanted to.
You could even change the course of the development. You are a powerful man, and
you perhaps don&#x2019;t even realize it.”
</p><!--l. 4783--><p class="indent" >  A plump woman approaches purposefully, with a lesser man in tow and, thankfully
ignores Den entirely. Rather he addresses himself to Howard. “Mister Rubin,” she
interrupts, “would you do me the honour of allowing me to present you to the Vice
Chancellor of the faculty of political studies.”
</p><!--l. 4789--><p class="indent" >  “I . . . Look, would you excuse me. I don&#x2019;t mean to be rude, but I have to speak to
someone quite urgently.”
</p><!--l. 4792--><p class="indent" >  It seems that the time for substantial conversation is over. People are becoming
weary and drunk. “Mr. Morris, you haven&#x2019;t touched your drink. That will never do.
Can I get you something else?”
</p><!--l. 4796--><p class="indent" >  “No, no thank you. Excuse me a moment, I have to ﬁnd a t. . .restroom.”
</p><!--l. 4798--><p class="indent" >  Howard looks to Den and seems to be about to say something, but the dinner gong
sounds once again. Saved by the tolling of the bell, Den thinks.
</p><!--l. 4802--><p class="indent" >  “Ladies and gentlemen, colleagues and guests, may I have your attention
please.”
</p><!--l. 4804--><p class="indent" >  The talking gradually desists and faces turn to ﬁnd the source of the voice. Den
makes his escape while he can, walking purposefully towards to hallway. He pushes
forward through the band of dignitaries and lesser mortals gathered in various states
of attire before him. Who on Earth have they not asked to this monsters&#x2019; ball? he
thinks.
</p><!--l. 4810--><p class="indent" >  “Those of you here today, are helping to build a better future for the world. .
.”
</p><!--l. 4813--><p class="indent" >  Den suppresses a pang of dismissal at the political rhetoric. Certainly there are
people here who believe in the game as the important channel of communication in
the future.
</p><!--l. 4817--><p class="indent" >  He decides to make his get-away while the speech is going on.
</p><!--l. 4819--><p class="indent" >  He almost walks into a man whom he learned to loathe at last year&#x2019;s meeting. Den
has been avoiding the wife of this man, whom he met last year. Celia Waites. She is

older than him, perhaps in her forties; she has been stalking him impatiently since
seeing him at the conference. He has been trying to avoid a meeting, given his
current involvement with Kim, but she catches up with him at the edge of the
room.
</p><!--l. 4827--><p class="indent" >  She is stunning in a tightly ﬁtting dress that highlights her perfectly preserved
ﬁgure. He is reminded of the reason they frequently ended up in his hotel
room last year. She might be older than him but her astonishing ﬁgure and
elegant attire makes her smoulder in a calm and demure way that he ﬁnds
alluring.
</p><!--l. 4833--><p class="indent" >  “Hi,” he says simply.
</p><!--l. 4835--><p class="indent" >  “Hello,” she looks up at him as if peeking under the rim of her eyebrows. “It&#x2019;s very
nice to see you here.”
</p><!--l. 4838--><p class="indent" >  He nods. “You look wonderful, as usual.”
</p><!--l. 4840--><p class="indent" >  “And so do you.”
</p><!--l. 4842--><p class="indent" >  “How are you?”
</p><!--l. 4844--><p class="indent" >  She tilts her head. “I am ﬁne.”
</p><!--l. 4846--><p class="indent" >  “So, how long will you be here in California?”
</p><!--l. 4848--><p class="indent" >  “I have to leave in a day or so from L.A..”
</p><!--l. 4850--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s a shame.”
</p><!--l. 4852--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, it is,” he agrees. “I like coming here.”
</p><!--l. 4854--><p class="indent" >  “You look good,” she states, plainly, wistfully, scanning him quickly with her
eyes.
</p><!--l. 4856--><p class="indent" >  “So how is your work here? Are you still running the economic detail?”
</p><!--l. 4858--><p class="indent" >  She nods. “It is chugging along as it should. It gets me out to see some faces, but it
does not excite me to the depths of my being.”
</p><!--l. 4861--><p class="indent" >  “I am sure you are appreciated.”
</p><!--l. 4863--><p class="indent" >  “Perhaps.”
</p><!--l. 4865--><p class="indent" >  “Well, these events are fun, once in a while, though,” he fumbles, lost for
words.
</p><!--l. 4867--><p class="indent" >  She smiles and brushes the remark aside. “So there might be time for a quick visit
from a handsome prince?”
</p><!--l. 4870--><p class="indent" >  He smiles at her genuinely. She is quite incredible, he thinks. “I would like that,” he
says. “But I don&#x2019;t think there will be an opportunity. My time is pretty much booked
up. Perhaps I can take you up on that another time.”
</p><!--l. 4875--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I don&#x2019;t know when I shall be available.”
</p><!--l. 4877--><p class="indent" >  He nods.
</p><!--l. 4879--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I can cross my ﬁngers.”
</p><!--l. 4881--><p class="indent" >  She looks back at him more sadly than in annoyance. Suddenly he feels a pang of
empathy for her. She is clearly a lonely woman, stuck in a lifestyle that neither
appreciates her style nor her wit. She smiles ruefully back, impaling him on her
sharp gaze, intense and wide-eyed. “You appalling man, Dennis,” she says.
“You know you are the best fuck in this sorry group. I&#x2019;m not asking you to
love me you know.” Then she smiles to make light of it. “Maybe next time,

then.”
</p><!--l. 4890--><p class="indent" >  They exchange stares, then she moves oﬀ, pushing her upper body against his,
making sure to brush against him in all the right places. He ﬁnds himself
uncomfortably aroused and sorely tempted.
</p><!--l. 4894--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Jesus, Den. Get a grip</span>, he thinks. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Take control of your life.</span>
</p><!--l. 4896--><p class="indent" >  He composes himself, quenching a pang of guilt, looks back at her as she walks
away from him and then presses on to the hallway, suppressing any further
thought.
</p><!--l. 4900--><p class="indent" >  He emerges into the spacious hallway and sees Cathy Kim standing by the
sculpture in the crossroads of the entrance hall. She ﬂashes a smile at him as he
approaches. “Hello, cowboy,” she ﬂirts. “How was your brunch?”
</p><!--l. 4905--><p class="indent" >  He blows air through trumpet lips and gives her a signiﬁcant look.
</p><!--l. 4907--><p class="indent" >  “Well, it&#x2019;s a good thing that we&#x2019;ll be staying here for a while. I am feeling a little
giddy.”
</p><!--l. 4910--><p class="indent" >  “You seemed to be heavily into a discussion about something,” he says.
</p><!--l. 4912--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, someone I have worked for earlier.”
</p><!--l. 4914--><p class="indent" >  “So how did you get here?”
</p><!--l. 4916--><p class="indent" >  “I caught a ride with a colleague. But I need a lift back.”
</p><!--l. 4918--><p class="indent" >  “Good.”
</p><!--l. 4920--><p class="indent" >  “So have you made any money? Any contacts?”
</p><!--l. 4922--><p class="indent" >  Den laughs. “No, these brunches are not for doing business. With luck, I
might still make some good contacts, or pick up something useful. How about
you?”
</p><!--l. 4926--><p class="indent" >  “I am here for fun. It&#x2019;s you I needed to meet.” She smiles; Den feels a tingle of
response.
</p><!--l. 4929--><p class="indent" >  “Happy to oblige. Of course, you realize that if I am going to be helping you with
your work, ours fortunes are intertwined.”
</p><!--l. 4932--><p class="indent" >  She grins back at him. “Then I should do my best to support you.”
</p><!--l. 4934--><p class="indent" >  “Let me rescue you from this rabble,” she says.
</p><!--l. 4936--><p class="indent" >  Music has started at the edge of the room again.
</p><!--l. 4938--><p class="indent" >  “Would you like to dance, Den?”
</p><!--l. 4940--><p class="indent" >  “So you think they can still pull this oﬀ, even with the story broken?”
</p><!--l. 4942--><p class="indent" >  She puts a hand on his rear and and clasps it. “Like Eisenhower said: take nothing
for granted.”

a day to recover from the climb up here and tend the blisters that her pampered
lifestyle has rendered her susceptible to. She is no stranger to the rugged lifestyle, but
it has been a while. Besides, she will not be able to defy the mountain police for
long.
</p><!--l. 4962--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Self-test. </span>She winces as neglected musculature bemoans its strife. Legs swing stiﬄy
oﬀ the bunk and meet with the icy cold wooden ﬂoor. A short trip today. I am not
going very far. Need to recharge soon.
</p><!--l. 4967--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Interface. </span>Picking up her wrist console from her pile of clothes on the ﬂoor, she
performs a quick scan. She is picking up a stray signal. It looks like a VeiVek. That, at
least, is good news. She makes a quick attempt to log on to the VeiVek&#x2019;s console, but
there is no answer.
</p><!--l. 4973--><p class="indent" >  A message has parked on her mobile. It is from the mountain rescue service. It tells
her that the mountain is still oﬀ limits, and tells her to call in immediately. She
considers the request. She ought to call in. She doesn&#x2019;t want to talk to them; on the
other hand, she doesn&#x2019;t want them coming after her and landing her with a ﬁne.
Perhaps she should just accept fate, roll over and wait for someone to cuﬀ and
incarcerate her. If there are gang ﬁghts out there, it could be dangerous, couldn&#x2019;t
it?
</p><!--l. 4982--><p class="indent" >  All right, she&#x2019;ll call in. But not yet. She has an appointment to keep ﬁrst. Still no
word from the French. Still no word from her supervisor at the research council. Fine
then, just abandon me in my time of need.

<!--l. 4993--><p class="indent" >  Everything was going well for Vibe until recently: work has been steady, progress
acceptable. Then came a letter to her group, informing them that her project
would most likely be cancelled due to changes in funding priorities. Just a
few months of life left, maybe? All her work this past year potentially to be
wasted, rendered useless in a single splurge of electronic administrative ink. All
for nothing. That is not something to lie down and accept. Not her. This is
about her future, her present. And let&#x2019;s not forget the past, while we&#x2019;re at
it.
</p><!--l. 5002--><p class="indent" >  She has been trying to contact Lindgren, her co-advisor who also works for the
Norwegian Research Council, for conﬁrmation of the letter — and general pleading
for clemency, but he has been unavailable. Unavailable! In other words, embarrassed
to speak to her. Bullshit.
</p><!--l. 5008--><p class="indent" >  And as if to add insult to the threat of injury, that was when she began to lose her
telemetry. One by one, and then in droves, she lost communication with her babies.
All of the chirping that she needed to complete the current phase of her work simply
stopped arriving. She investigated and met with nonsense. She wailed for help, but no
one bothered to reply to a stupid graduate student. She contacted the group of French
technicians who deployed them and received no more than a non-committal
text.
</p><!--l. 5017--><p class="indent" >  With no one helping, it seemed like a good time to ﬂee the city and come up here to
see what was going on. So she asked for leave to go into the ﬁeld. Expecting
hesitation, she was met only with administrative obstinacy—a perfect reason to ﬂout
their wishes and come here to see with her own eyes.
</p><!--l. 5023--><p class="indent" >  How freakin&#x2019; hard could they make it for her?
</p><!--l. 5025--><p class="indent" >  Someone is just not on her side. she thinks. But here in the mountains, few things
matter in the quite the same way. City matters seem to pale beside the power of nature,
and mere human matters are rendered trivial by the basic matter of survival. This is a
good place to be at a time like this.
</p><!--l. 5031--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">You freak, Vibe</span>, she thinks. <span

<!--l. 5039--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Recharging. </span>After breakfast, she feels detached from the city. Even a brief bout of
messaging with Bea does not refocus her self-image. She needs snacks for the day:
chocolate to stave oﬀ the provinciality of her surroundings.
</p><!--l. 5044--><p class="indent" >  Access goodies, digg, snop, cleansing sugar. A young man is in line in front

of her at the front desk. He looks like he has been holed up here for a few
days. He looks bored and a little too comfortable. He too craves something
sweet.
</p><!--l. 5049--><p class="indent" >  “We have chocolates, muﬃns, sugar candy. . .”
</p><!--l. 5051--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah, I&#x2019;ll take a muﬃns,” he says.
</p><!--l. 5053--><p class="indent" >  Vibe cringes. He could be quite good looking, but the momentary illusion is
shattered by this linguistic stupidity. “It&#x2019;s a muﬃn,” she hears herself protest,
involuntarily and instantly regrets it.
</p><!--l. 5057--><p class="indent" >  The man turns around. “Yeah, a muﬃns.”
</p><!--l. 5059--><p class="indent" >  “No,” she insists, “just muﬃn. There is no &#x2019;s&#x2019; on the end.”
</p><!--l. 5061--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Shut up! It doesn&#x2019;t matter, girl.</span>
</p><!--l. 5063--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m pretty sure he said muﬃns.”
</p><!--l. 5065--><p class="indent" >  “One muﬃn, several muﬃns. It&#x2019;s English.”
</p><!--l. 5067--><p class="indent" >  <span

</p><!--l. 5069--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah? So who made you the expert?”
</p><!--l. 5071--><p class="indent" >  He takes his muﬃn and leaves with a wince.
</p><!--l. 5073--><p class="indent" >  Jerk. She shudders in annoyance and embarrassment at her own bitchiness. Adding
extraneous s&#x2019;s to English words is a Norwegian disability that her upbringing has
taught her to despise. Muﬃns, caps, binders? Had Peter Green been here, he would
have just loved her now for defending their language, wouldn&#x2019;t he? It is important to
know these things, if you want to impress someone. Now she has gotten oﬀ on the
wrong foot with this guy, probably one of the few people here at the cabin at this time
of year.
</p><!--l. 5082--><p class="indent" >  Queue service event. The desk-guy is looking at her blankly with characteristic
Norwegian alacrity. Now it is she who is standing there stupidly, thinking about the
wrong things,
</p><!--l. 5086--><p class="indent" >  “Chocolate please,” she says. “And don&#x2019;t spare the horses.”
</p><!--l. 5088--><p class="indent" >  The man looks at her oddly as she waves her wrist interface over the sensor to pay.
As she does so, a text message comes in on her mobile,
</p><!--l. 5091--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">”Relaying, ad hoc. Will be at Leirvassbu tomorrow evening. Problems. Conﬁrm</span>

</p><!--l. 5093--><p class="indent" >  The French. So they are not falling over themselves to meet her. Conﬁrm receipt,
my ass. What does she expect? They probably only take her half-seriously, just a kid.
Just a grad student.
</p><!--l. 5097--><p class="indent" >  Then she sees the time the message was sent. Yesterday, last night. The
message has been travelling ad hoc, they said. That means they have not been
able to contact her directly by main net. Where are they? Somewhere oﬀ the
net.
</p><!--l. 5102--><p class="indent" >  Well. At least that gives her time to rest here today. She is closer to ﬁnding out what
is going on, even if they are not telling. Cool, if she could ﬁgure it out without them. .
.
</p><!--l. 5106--><p class="indent" >  She arranges to keep her room for another night, takes the chocolate and ﬂees to her
room. She is not supposed to go anywhere, but still. Her mobile is already visible to

the locator devices of the police, and the cabin personnel know that everyone is
supposed to stay put while they round up the war-gamers, but she does not like
leaving things to chance.
</p><!--l. 5113--><p class="indent" >  In her room, she unpacks what she needs from her large backpack and stuﬀs it into
a smaller day-sack. Clothing herself for rainy weather, but light travel, she abandons
the luxuries and concentrates on equipment for the VeiVeks. She ought to be able to
ﬁnd a few near here, given their last reported positions. A little food. Chocolate. She
downloads maps into her mobile, in case she loses the signal out there. She is almost
ready for Moon-walk.

<!--l. 5125--><p class="indent" >  The VeiVek project is a collaborative project between NASA and ESA and the
RKA. It is a test of space engineering and robot rover technologies for rugged terrain
exploration and mission maintenance. On Mars mission, or Titan trek, little robots like
this have to get around in rugged terrain and perform actual work: everything from
collecting samples to repairing equipment.
</p><!--l. 5132--><p class="indent" >  Some, of course, would like to use these robots for defusing mine ﬁelds or other
terrestrial bombs, but that is not an application that she feels inclined to think too
much about.
</p><!--l. 5136--><p class="indent" >  They come in all diﬀerent sizes and classes of capabilities. Instead of one
all-singing, all-roving robot, the space technologists have gone for a strategy of
making several smaller, lighter, specialist robots that work as a team. A creative,
collaborative ecology of workers.
</p><!--l. 5142--><p class="indent" >  Some are made in the U.S., some in Georgia, some in the Netherlands. And then
there is Sara Stensrud. She has been teaching them to collaborate.
</p><!--l. 5147--><p class="indent" >  She needs to carry around some connecting probes for emergency inspection. The
little robots are all supposed to interface together, without wires, but they do not all
have the same hardware or software. That means she has to wander around in the
wilderness looking for them. If the central controller had been operational, she could
have called them all in to her location for analysis, but she cannot even interface with
the controller station.
</p><!--l. 5157--><p class="indent" >  This work is a brilliant idea. What better locations than the mountain tourist trails to
see if the bots can monitor the environment, perform maintenance and detect life? But
times have changed since the idea was envisaged. The mountain regions are full of
challenges, both environmental and human. Now they have become a playground for
gang war-games.

There is the door. . .

</p><!--l. 5168--><p class="indent" >  She crawls out of the small window in her room and clambers through tall wet grass
and marshy mosses to the trail, hoping that she can get far enough away before
someone notices that she is gone. She feels the inclement cold of the morning bite into
her, but soon she will be boiling hot and sweaty from climbing. Oﬀ we go. Back in no
time, so no biggy..
</p><!--l. 5175--><p class="indent" >  In daylight optimism, challenges are fresh and bodily suﬀering soon forgotten. The
trees are no longer sentinels but ushers, welcoming her to a path that winds and
shrinks to a speck, far too quickly, up the forested valley. The horns of the valley rise
up vertically, guarding the pass, way oﬀ in the distance.
</p><!--l. 5181--><p class="indent" >  On the other side of that channel, she should ﬁnd what she is looking for. Perhaps

</p><!--l. 5194--><p class="indent" >  It will not be long before the weather becomes too poor to have these rovers out
walking around. They will have to plant themselves for the winter or go to a

they will not cope with the snow and they do not grip well on mosses and
slimes.
</p><!--l. 5200--><p class="indent" >  The little locust-like device is only about ﬁfteen centimetres long and gets around
by walking and hopping on its six insect legs. Its ultra-light carbon nano-ﬁbres and
plastics are dark and almost translucent; it almost blends in to the scenery
invisibly. Supposedly there is an ultra thin hot air balloon inside here somewhere
that could lift it out of trouble if need be. If it is true then this one seems
to have forgotten it. It has a small probe and collector for measuring soil
conductivity and samples of vegetation. The little bio-memetic robot hops across a
boulder like a grasshopper, skidding to a tentative halt on the slippery rock
plane.
</p><!--l. 5212--><p class="indent" >  Vibe interfaces with the robot&#x2019;s software and veriﬁes that it is functioning normally.

</p><!--l. 5223--><p class="indent" >  She crouches down to take some pictures to verify the condition of the
path and match it to the Veiv&#x2019;s assessment. Some of the small leaves here,

which have not been rained away, are coated in a dusty deposit that could be
from the metal ore processing plant down at the head of the fjord. She can
analyze that separately. Now she will need samples from the top and bottom
of the plant to see any anomalous DNA eﬀects due to radiation damage in
the ﬂora and fauna. A single sample will not show much, but a principal
component analysis should be able to show up some kind of trend if there is
one. There will be suﬃcient data to correlate any patterns with the maps
of the magnetic disturbances. Someone else&#x2019;s job, but she is happy to be a
messenger.
</p><!--l. 5235--><p class="indent" >  Solar radiation is quite high as the magnetic pole steadily weakens up
here. It is an ironic turn of events that the genetically manipulated plants
introduced here to provide a fuel source for the larger VeiVeks, could be
reprogrammed almost as soon as they are introduced in to nature by the increased
radiation. What exactly will the mutation rate be when the magnetic pole starts its
ﬁbrillations?

<!--l. 5247--><p class="indent" >  In the distance, an echo, almost imperceptible. A human voice? A bird? She moves
on. Nothing to see here, folks. Move along.
</p><!--l. 5250--><p class="indent" >  She climbs higher. At the top of the pass, the valley opens into a plateau: Martian
moonscape, re-touched in green. Scratchy crystalline deposits of something
coppery glisten on the surface of the boulders here. The scree could be nature&#x2019;s
quarry for mineral riches, but the large boulders and deep cracks are simply a
hazard for the robots. Only the largest maintenance-bots could cross this,
with their paint-guns and cleaning solvents, painting their tourist T&#x2019;s and
scrubbing oﬀ graﬃti that would have been unthinkable when she came here as a
child.
</p><!--l. 5260--><p class="indent" >  Oﬃcially she is out here to observe these little robots, investigate the controller
problems, and conﬁrm their ability to perform maintenance and detect bacterial life.
But most of that could have been done from the so-called comfort of her oﬃce, or
through a VR interface to the game that she has been working on. It is an
indulgence, coming out here. She could have waited. But Vibe doesn&#x2019;t wait. She
acts.
</p><!--l. 5267--><p class="indent" >  Hey. Snow is supposed to be good at trapping bacteria and gases. Perhaps she will
ﬁnd some of her kids along the snow line. Best keep plodding up.

</p><!--l. 5272--><p class="noindent" >*</p></div>
<!--l. 5275--><p class="indent" >  Plod. Plod.
</p><!--l. 5277--><p class="indent" >  Approval. Out here again, on the expanse of this range, a shell of urban platitudes
seems to separate and lift from her dorsal conscience. It brings with it a clarity of
perspective that is unusually humbling. It seems hard to imagine why she has been so
wound up about things recently. Troubles with childish boys, posing as men, dreams
of men posing as dreams, worries about her work and the possible demise
of the project. These ancient mountains hardly care about such trivia and
yet they have survived millennia. Surely, if she can survive them, she will
live.
</p><!--l. 5287--><p class="indent" >  Still, she should never forget that she is here on suﬀerance. Her advisor, or one of
the three who are supposedly guiding her in this work, Professor Hart, did not take to
the idea of her ﬁeld work.
</p><!--l. 5291--><p class="indent" >  She argued with him.
</p><!--l. 5293--><p class="indent" >  She recalls his face becoming grimmer and grimmer as she felt herself
decline in his estimation. Hart, the big man. It was Dr Jonas Lindgren, a
well-known ecologist, who had just moved to a position serving on the research
council, who defended her. Hart seemed to view her as a perfectly formed
chocolate tea-pot, perfect in form and theory, but ready to melt at the ﬁrst meeting
with reality—as soon as she got into hot water. Lindgren, though always
distracted and distant, had encouraged her to pursue traditional scientiﬁc values of
empiricism.
</p><!--l. 5303--><p class="indent" >  “It could not be more important,” Lindgren said, “especially when you work in the
technologies like information science. Engineering is seldom practised as a science
these days. It is driven by stupid bureaucrats like I am destined to become, if I stay
here too long.”
</p><!--l. 5308--><p class="indent" >  She is grateful for his moral support. But it was her father, before he died, whose
encouragement ﬁlled her with the approval to take a chance on her convictions—to
pursue science as an adventure, not as a bureaucratic penance, that would bring more
aggravation than comfort. He worked then for the Centre of Non-linear Science
in San Diego with the Americans and their French colleagues. With Peter
Green.
</p><!--l. 5315--><p class="indent" >  Plod.
</p><!--l. 5317--><p class="indent" >  Plod.
</p><!--l. 5319--><p class="indent" >  Vibe&#x2019;s family has been instrumental in her making. Her father was a simple man
who liked nature. Her interest in ecosystems comes from him. He would never have
spoken openly of something so pretentious though. Her father was a private man, but
his work was something out of the ordinary. Something that she had never felt
comfortable asking him about. He was not a military man, but he was visited by a lot
of military types: men and women in uniform. She would hole up in her room and
play the clarinet when these American visitors came. Later her father would
apologize and tell her to be careful around such men. As a twelve year old, she

never did fully understand what he was talking about—now she could only
guess.
</p><!--l. 5332--><p class="indent" >  Her mother has always been the intellectual of the family and Vibe is somewhere in
between all of her family members.
</p><!--l. 5335--><p class="indent" >  Her little brother, strangely enough, was her main comfort growing up. She realises
that brothers and sisters are not supposed to like each other, but her brother was
straightforward and attentive, if nothing else. She played his games with him and
they explored VR together when they could no longer get away to see the
Real World. Their mother had the bright idea to give them a supplemented
education, which kept them more isolated than normal kids of their age. She
promised them that they would thank her for it eventually. Her brother made
it possible for the apparent chore to be fun. She would help him with his
studies; he would help her with her bitterness at being singled out amongst her
friends.
</p><!--l. 5347--><p class="indent" >  She doesn&#x2019;t hear much from him these days. He spends much of his time living a
lie, brandishing secrecy, evasion and circumlocution in order to prevent anyone,
except his closest, from knowing him; speciﬁcally from ﬁnding out that he is gay. It is
sad, she thinks, to invest so much eﬀort in implicit deception. But how is she any
better?
</p><!--l. 5353--><p class="indent" >  ‘Vibe&#x2019; was also her brother&#x2019;s joke. It came from her penchant for American accents
and her mastery of the clarinet. The Americans could never pronounce her middle
name. Her real name is Vibeke, but the Americans pronounce it insistently as if it
were part of the anatomy of a duck, so he shortened it with a hip kind of brevity that
better ﬁt her sensibility. And her musical interest.
</p><!--l. 5361--><p class="indent" >  Vibe.
</p><!--l. 5363--><p class="indent" >  Vibe.
</p><!--l. 5365--><p class="indent" >  Vibe.
</p><!--l. 5367--><p class="indent" >  Sara.
</p><!--l. 5369--><p class="indent" >  Vibeke.
</p><!--l. 5371--><p class="indent" >  Stensrud.
</p><!--l. 5373--><p class="indent" >  Duck.
</p><!--l. 5375--><p class="indent" >  Beak.
</p><!--l. 5377--><p class="indent" >  America.
</p><!--l. 5379--><p class="indent" >  What are you thinking?
</p><!--l. 5382--><p class="indent" >  Then there was Bea. Almost family. They did pretty much everything together once
they had ﬁnally managed to become friends. They looked at each other skeptically,
from afar. Each one presumed that the other was aloof and would not be interested in
talking. Each one secretly admired the other.
</p><!--l. 5388--><p class="indent" >  Vibe.
</p><!--l. 5390--><p class="indent" >  VeiVek.
</p><!--l. 5392--><p class="indent" >  Vibe.
</p><!--l. 5394--><p class="indent" >  Disappointment.
</p><!--l. 5396--><p class="indent" >  Peter Green.

</p><!--l. 5398--><p class="indent" >  After her encounter, she forgot about him for a long time. She would tease
boys with her newly found sexuality. It was a good way to wrap them around
her little ﬁnger, or to wrap herself around their little ﬁnger if she so desired.
Always playing the role, cool Vibe. She and Bea. Until she realized who she
was.
</p><!--l. 5404--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Look at me. Just a spoilt bitch. I&#x2019;m just a freaking cartoon character.</span>
</p><!--l. 5406--><p class="indent" >  So she studied. Long story. Cut it short. Suddenly, the VeiVeks stopped responding
at her terminal. She contacted the American team and asked who was working on the
ﬁeld deployment.
</p><!--l. 5410--><p class="indent" >  That was when the surprise struck. Peter Green. She saw his picture. It was
him. Years later, in a diﬀerent world, they were to meet again. She had not
forgotten her encounter, but it had been consigned to the past. But the temptation
seemed too great to resist. Suddenly there were two reasons to come here in
person.
</p><!--l. 5416--><p class="indent" >  How rational is that? Coming here, hoping to re-live a moment of fantasy, that she
has undoubtedly ampliﬁed beyond all reason in the resonance of her mind? Certainly
it is not rational.
</p><!--l. 5420--><p class="indent" >  But, after all this time, she wants to know what he is really like. The thrill of danger
from a safe friend of her father. What more could a girl ask? So why? If only to dispel
an adolescent fantasy.
</p><!--l. 5424--><p class="indent" >  Vibe.
</p><!--l. 5426--><p class="indent" >  Plod.
</p><!--l. 5428--><p class="indent" >  Plod.
</p><!--l. 5430--><p class="indent" >  Vibe.
</p><!--l. 5432--><p class="indent" >  She treads from boulder to boulder, always with excellent balance and coordination.
The steady plodding, the regular breathing, the aching of muscle. This sudoriﬁc
incantation to the mountain.
</p>

<!--l. 5437--><p class="noindent" >
</p><!--l. 5438--><p class="noindent" >*</p></div>
<!--l. 5441--><p class="indent" >  A whoosh and then a crack that echoes once only in the damp air. A feint fragment
of a voice wisps in the wind. She remembers the warning about gangs. The gangs with
the paint riﬂes.
</p><!--l. 5445--><p class="indent" >  She looks around and sees a splash of yellow paint nearby. The larger VeiVek that
she is standing over perks into life as its ocular sensor detects the ﬂagrant colour. It
begins to move towards the area, ready to act with its solvents. But it is a hopeless
task. This little eco-robot cannot possibly carry enough solvent to wash away this
kind of vandalism, even recharging itself regularly from the modiﬁed plant
sources.
</p><!--l. 5453--><p class="indent" >  The rain will probably do it eventually. The paint is most likely water based. She

considers talking sense into it, but just makes a note to alter their programming later
tonight.
</p><!--l. 5457--><p class="indent" >  Then she sees it.
</p><!--l. 5459--><p class="indent" >  Another little robot, not far away, hit by a splash of the same paint. Probably it sent
a distress signal and this other one has been on its way to the rescue. Now the rescuer
is reevaluating its priorities. The rain of paint is throwing the VeiVeks into confusion.
It is all happening too fast for them. They expect their world to change slowly, now
the environment is changing around them.
</p><!--l. 5466--><p class="indent" >  She clambers over the uneven ground towards the other robot. It is damaged. Not
just discoloured. It has lost a leg and another is broken. Helping it would be useless at
this point. It needs to be repaired.
</p><!--l. 5471--><p class="indent" >  She considers putting its thirty centimetres into her pack to take down to the cabin,
but decides against it. Might as well leave it here as a net relay. One thing she has
learned is that these robots are actually communicating—working the way she has
always intended them to work. Now that their central controller has gone away, they
have started to make the best of what little communication they can to establish
contact with their neighbours, to solicit help when needed.
</p><!--l. 5479--><p class="indent" >  The loss of a central command is actually perfect for her research. The idea was
always that, instead of centralized control, they would form a community of
collaborating agents, each with their own specializations, and each working
independently as part of a collective. A society of mind, as Minsky put it. But NASA
and the RKA were against the idea, telling her that it was too uncertain. They wanted
a military-style centralization of command and monitoring for the robots. Like Cape
Canaveral on ice. Now the central command point has been taken out somehow, or is
not working. The little robots have started to communicate with each other instead,
just as she had originally planned.
</p><!--l. 5492--><p class="indent" >  Another shot cracks close by and she hears actual laughter now. Stupid male
Neanderthal jerk. She can&#x2019;t stay here.
</p><!--l. 5495--><p class="indent" >  Another paint-ball lands near to her. Are they shooting at her or at the robots?
Shit.
</p><!--l. 5498--><p class="indent" >  “Fine, herd me fucker.”
</p><!--l. 5500--><p class="indent" >  She pulls out her hand-held to get a better interface and scans for private band
com-channels to see if she can get a signal strength. It might tell her how close they
are. She can see three networks in addition to the public access point: NRBKN,
NLSKN and NASA-VV. She starts at the last of these. It is a signal from one of the
VeiVeks. Instantly, she forgets about the immediate threat and attempts to log on to the
signal. It accepts her key code and her password and she is admitted to the interface of
the robot.
</p><!--l. 5509--><p class="indent" >  She wonders just how far she could reach into their little network by piggy-backing
oﬀ their ad hoc internetwork. If she can talk to one, and it can talk to another, who can
talk to another across the horizon. . .she might, in principle, be able to access nearly
all of the little robots.
</p><!--l. 5515--><p class="indent" >  She accesses the newcomer and looks at its communications log. It has contact

recently with two others. She tries to follow their addresses, but they have moved out
of horizon, probably when this one came here to render assistance to the crippled
unit.
</p><!--l. 5520--><p class="indent" >  The status of the two robots robot seem to be ok, apart from its broken legs.. She
attempts to get a picture to see what is going on. She reaches the camera in the larger
robot and it is working well. If she could interface to the ad hoc network, she could
use the VeiVeks to survey the landscape.
</p><!--l. 5526--><p class="indent" >  She hears another whoosh and a splash of colour explodes onto the rock some
metres away from her. More laughter now, closer. It is clearly her they are
targeting. Good thing they are incompetent, probably drunk. Time to get out of
here.
</p><!--l. 5531--><p class="indent" >  She recalls the message she received this morning and takes a moment to echo the
gesture by inserting a message into the communications buﬀer of the newcomer. Then
she adds a backtrack instruction to its priority list and sees it falter in its eﬀorts to
cross the boulders, and turn.
</p><!--l. 5537--><p class="indent" >  The sunlight level is low today, so its power levels are probably low, but it will
eventually go back the way it came.
</p><!--l. 5540--><p class="indent" >  Vibe frees her hands of as much mobile gear as possible. She picks up
the broken VeiVek and takes it with her. She will carry it with her a short
distance to form a relay closer to the cabin. It might be possible to use it
later to access the VeiVeks from the cabin room. Then she turns and skips
rapidly across the boulders, in a zig zag, back to the cabin, back the way she
came.

</p><!--l. 5550--><p class="indent" >  Blink.
</p><!--l. 5552--><p class="indent" >  A head turns, face staring up through eyebrows. In the semi-darkness you would be
forgiven for thinking her skin was blue. Her skin. Yes, deﬁnitely a she. The eyes close
for a long moment and re-open. The shadow of long dark hair, pushed behind ears,
frames a narrow but attractive face, apparently in need of rest. Skinny blue-brown
arms protrude from a lively white sari jumbled with untidy youth and energy. A child?
A young woman? <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Age can be deceptive, isn&#x2019;t it? </span>It doesn&#x2019;t matter, either
way.
</p><!--l. 5561--><p class="indent" >  Blink. Preeta knows her limitations, but the computer refuses to play along. She is
totally exhausted from these past few days, yet the cursor blinks at her incessantly,
waiting for her input. Now! it says, I am ready, what are you waiting for?
Type!
</p><!--l. 5566--><p class="indent" >  Her concentration hovers between the captive screen and every avenue of
possible digression, as she tests the boundaries of her fatigue. If she can hold
out for just a few hours more, there will be a chance for sleep. She has the
night oﬀ from the chapati van. If she can just escape from this high tech
incarceration.
</p><!--l. 5572--><p class="indent" >  Outside, palms sway in a late afternoon gust of wind as if rattled by the passing
traﬃc on the carriage-way. She senses a heavy, brooding air mounting the roof of the
city, just beyond the glass pane. It brings a slight thrill of nervousness, like an
encroaching menace over a Gotham Asia. With the fan in her tiny bedsit broken, it
will help to have a cooling force tonight, however inconstant it turns out to
be.
</p><!--l. 5579--><p class="indent" >  Preeta Dhawan rises from her place amongst the rows of programmers and walks
modestly to the washroom to splash some water onto her face. She tries hard to
maintain outward appearances here. She must not show that she is weary of the
work she has been assigned. She needs to keep this job, at least for now,
even if it is causing her some measure of mental anguish. More importantly,

she must not show any sign that her boss&#x2019;s intimidations have any eﬀect on
her.
</p><!--l. 5587--><p class="indent" >  The washroom is empty. She is afraid that someone will notice how often she
spends here. Fortunately this futuristic domicile is spacious and busy and few have
time to pay her much attention. She looks at her greying visage in the high tech
mirror. She is tired, yes, but look how far she has come. She has escaped from one
oppressive life, moved into two new ones, but she is half way to her dreams, isn&#x2019;t she?
Her features are drawn, but a few hours sleep and her charming youth will be
restored. If that is the case, why doesn&#x2019;t it feel that way? She stretches her neck
muscles.
</p><!--l. 5597--><p class="indent" >  She feels, these past days, that she understands how a turtle must feel being kept in
a box. Her right ﬂipper aches from the typing and the mouse of her computer. Her rear
end is numb from sitting. It is made worse since they would not even give her a left
handed mouse. She takes a moment to savour the lower light level in the washroom,
relieves herself and then she slips out of the washroom into the hallway, to return to
her terminal.
</p><!--l. 5606--><p class="indent" >  “Wait!” shouts a voice from down the hall and she feels a javelin of dread pierce her
good fortune. It seems almost inevitable. She turns to look at the fat little man who
brought her here and who still holds her captive. “What progress have you made?” He
sleazes towards her with an artiﬁcial smile. Her boss. He knows that he owns her,
having brought her here from the Indian branch, where she started her unlikely career,
in Bangalore. He reminds her of it at every opportunity. She calls him Mota. Fat
boy.
</p><!--l. 5615--><p class="indent" >  “Nothing yet,” she replies as congenially as she can.
</p><!--l. 5617--><p class="indent" >  “You&#x2019;ll need to work extra hours to solve this. This contract is very important you
know.”
</p><!--l. 5620--><p class="indent" >  “I know,” she says. “But I should take a rest soon, you know. You know, approach it
with a fresh mind.”
</p><!--l. 5623--><p class="indent" >  “You will do as you are told, girl, isn&#x2019;t it!”
</p><!--l. 5625--><p class="indent" >  She scowls. “There must be someone else you can ask.” She knows there
isn&#x2019;t.
</p><!--l. 5627--><p class="indent" >  “You will stay. There are people coming to inspect our progress. We have
deadlines.”
</p><!--l. 5630--><p class="indent" >  “I need to talk to you about something important.”
</p><!--l. 5632--><p class="indent" >  Mota looks straight through her and gestures to someone else. She knows he is
listening to her, but there is a way about him that tells her she is incidental, that she
does not matter to him. She is just another piece of machinery in this oﬃce. Well, that
is about to change, she thinks.
</p><!--l. 5638--><p class="indent" >  “Later. When you have done your chores,” he mumbles dismissively and wanders
away, already focused on someone else.
</p><!--l. 5641--><p class="indent" >  She looks at him coldly, uncertain whether to hate him or feel sorry for him. She
could simply leave. But can she sabotage this ﬂagrant attempt to control her? No. For
him it is simply his right. She can see the wheels going around in his supposedly

superior head. I do not belong to any caste, she thinks. I belong to society. Nor do I
even want to belong to India. I am culturally Asian and that is enough. Don&#x2019;t look at
me that way, you bastard.
</p><!--l. 5649--><p class="indent" >  He will not deign to touch a computer. He is a Hindu snob. He just gives the orders.
Typical that he thinks the computer is just another Untouchable. Stupid primitive.
He is like some hopeless bureaucrat trying to be a Bollywood parody of a
real man. Alas this little private internal speech does not help her situation.
He could ﬁnd someone else to help her out, but he does not want to. Like
her father before him, he sees her as his slave, using guilt to reign her in.
As usual, through his own inaction, his refusal to employ more analysts, he
manages to get her to do the job. Her conscience is her weakness and she knows
it.
</p><!--l. 5660--><p class="indent" >  But she hates the way he treats her with utter contempt, giving her a look of utmost
superiority. Like a servant, or a server. With a little sticker slapped on her forehead
“Dalit Inside”. Not that he would recognize one if he saw one or understand what that
meant. But she must not let him see it. He is not going to get the better of her
mind.
</p><!--l. 5667--><p class="indent" >  He is abruptly distracted by something else and turns away, seeming to forget about
her. She takes the opportunity to slip back to her terminal, out the scope of his
radar.
</p><!--l. 5671--><p class="indent" >  As she walks into the terminal room of this oﬃce tower, her gaze extends
to the darkening outside world. One can see far from here. The lure of the
Padang rises in her. She follows the progress of a solitary tuk tuk amongst the
shining air conditioned vehicles as they pass by the Samad. Imagine if she just
jumped onto it and asked to be taken to Europe. She has come this far, so why
not?
</p><!--l. 5678--><p class="indent" >  Her glance falls glumly back into the matt sheen of her monitor. There is too much
light reﬂecting in it, giving her a headache, but she cannot spend time worrying about
that now. She did not take time out of the University to feel sorry for herself. She
needs the money and she is working on a bonus.
</p><!--l. 5684--><p class="indent" >  She has been working on this particular job now for months. The program is
coming along, but tracking this bug has led her nowhere. Even a wild goose chase
would be preferable to this insuﬀerably endless game of cricket. Her only trump card
is that she is actually good at her job. Whatever shortcuts she has had to take in her
education, she has surprised herself in ﬁnding her calling: analysis. That is why he
needs her. I am good, she thinks.
</p><!--l. 5692--><p class="indent" >  At least she has a home here. After all, in her family&#x2019;s eyes she is dead. The
nightmare is still there, in the forefront of her mind, even after all this time. The whole
journey. Shame and dishonour, unleashed by an impassioned refusal. Propelled from
an ordinary family home, into unforgiving streets of Srinagar, with only the
clothes on her back and the merest hope of escape. Some connection to her
past died at that point, as though a binge on some alcoholic dream ﬁnally
damaged her brain with a selective loss of emotion so that she could turn

her back and leave without regrets. And yet it was the indulgent folly of her
enquiring mind that brought her here, along an unlikely trail, far from that
shepherded upbringing to this virtual sweat shop, to a new and completely diﬀerent
country. But that was almost seven years ago, and there is no time for this
day-dream.
</p><!--l. 5706--><p class="indent" >  She begins to scan through the code where she left oﬀ, adding tracers. Preeta has
never been much of an artist, but she can admire some of the newer fragments of code,
like stanzas of poetry, that illuminate the passages of hackery in the original program.
They stand out. She has been programming now for three years, but she does
not feel yet that she has found a style that she can live by. Programming is
almost like a lifestyle. The code she writes says something about her basic
attitudes.
</p><!--l. 5715--><p class="indent" >  These nested loops, have a certain strange beauty to them. There is no fat, every
statement is a precise and minimal instruction to the kernel exec. There is a
push and pull, a question and answer, a conversation going on that she ﬁnds
fascinating. Never would she have imagined that such a program might be possible.
The complexity alone is breathtaking—and yet she understands it, piece by
piece, verse by verse. She almost feels that she can play the game in her
own mind, but by reading these logical statements on the monitor in front of
her.
</p><!--l. 5725--><p class="indent" >  The ticking revolutions of a watch&#x2019;s hand meet her casual glance on screen two.
The test program is still running with only one tenth of the modules loaded. Without
this amount of simpliﬁcation, she would be unable to run a simulation at
all.
</p><!--l. 5730--><p class="indent" >  She sighs in frustration. Any normal girl would be surrounded by her girlfriends
chatting about romance and manipulating men, but Preeta is not any normal girl and
she has had her ﬁll of manipulation. For ten years of her life her father ruled her by
guilt from his wheelchair.
</p><!--l. 5736--><p class="indent" >  Her teachers have taught her the power of simulation here at the University in
Kuala Lumpur, and she has found that it is a considerable help in ﬁguring out the
chains of cause and eﬀect within the program. Most of her studies at the University
have been simulations. Malaysia is not a poor country, but funds for education are
always limited. Besides, Preeta has always enjoyed fantasy and using her
imagination.
</p><!--l. 5744--><p class="indent" >  The levels ﬂuctuate up and down madly. The power spectrum is almost
down to 1.5 – a long way oﬀ exponential. She has been told to expect this,
and her comparisons with the limited data that she has been given by the
contractor conﬁrm this. What is strange is that the queue lengths are not
growing signiﬁcantly, but the CPU load is at such a low level. Everything is
taking a long time. Instead of rising to the provocation like a hive of angry
wasps, this simulation is merely grinding along more like a windmill in a light
breeze.
</p><!--l. 5753--><p class="indent" >  This is not going to happen today. Wait! There it is again! On the output log, a

message appears.
</p><!--l. 5756--><p class="indent" >  She recognizes the message. She has seen it several times lately. They have stared
to appear quite often now. In the logs the program is complaining, “No exit this way.
Better backtrack and try again.”
</p><!--l. 5760--><p class="indent" >  At ﬁrst the message seemed to defy explanation. It did not sound like a
programming message, or an error condition. What could have caused it? What was it
asking for? Then her curiosity is piqued. She begins to search in the code base, using
her analyst access to access the module docs. She discovers that the message is
not an error message at all. It comes from the game itself. The message is
advice to the VR players in a tactical setting. It is telling them to change their
tactics.
</p><!--l. 5769--><p class="indent" >  Now it is appearing in the logs, perhaps due to some buﬀer overﬂow or
memory error. The message is clearly an error, but ironically appropriate.
Backtracking is exactly what they now must do in order to solve this mystery.
They will want this ﬁxed. Their employers see the game as too important
to leave it alone. She smiles at the thought of the game actually playing its
programmers.

<!--l. 5783--><p class="indent" >  The sky has shrunken into a dark glove around Kuala Lumpur as the incoming
message registers on her console. There is little more than reﬂection to be seen
through the windows of the programmers&#x2019; den now. Her reﬂection is drawn
and weary. Preeta tenses with a mixture of excitement and trepidation at the
continuation of this adventure. Suddenly she does not regret having to stay
late.
</p><!--l. 5790--><p class="indent" >  She has been exchanging messages with this mystery X who calls himself JP for
weeks, even months, passing on her ﬁndings. All that she knows is that this person
works for the game consortium, or at least has access to its private channels. She
chooses the game silent mode as always; she cannot talk aloud here in the den. Also,
she routes the visual to her glasses for privacy. No one could suspect that she is not
still debugging.
</p><!--l. 5797--><p class="indent" >  She ﬁnds herself in a small room that looks like a cafe.
</p><!--l. 5799--><p class="indent" >  “It has been a while,” she says. “I thought you had gone away.”
</p><!--l. 5801--><p class="indent" >  “Had to lie low for a while – when the story broke. Even though it was expected
eventually, it was not supposed to come out this fast.”
</p><!--l. 5804--><p class="indent" >  “So why now?”
</p><!--l. 5806--><p class="indent" >  “I need your help again.”
</p><!--l. 5808--><p class="indent" >  “I think I know what you are going to ask.”

</p><!--l. 5810--><p class="indent" >  “Good.”
</p><!--l. 5812--><p class="indent" >  “This is exciting”
</p><!--l. 5814--><p class="indent" >  Pause. There is a long wait. Are they sizing her up, or is her counterpart actually a
computer program?
</p><!--l. 5817--><p class="indent" >  “I could make it more exciting. You could really help us.”
</p><!--l. 5819--><p class="indent" >  “Maybe you could get me a job in the U.S.?”
</p><!--l. 5821--><p class="indent" >  “You want to work somewhere else? The good life? Beautiful women?”
</p><!--l. 5823--><p class="indent" >  She smiles. The person, if it is one, does not know that she is a woman. Naturally
she appears as a man in VR.
</p><!--l. 5826--><p class="indent" >  “Sure. Beautiful women. :)”
</p><!--l. 5828--><p class="indent" >  There is another pause.
</p><!--l. 5830--><p class="indent" >  “The U.S. is not good. Europe is best. We can move you if you are ready.”
</p><!--l. 5833--><p class="indent" >  “Why not the U.S.?”
</p><!--l. 5835--><p class="indent" >  “Public interest.”
</p><!--l. 5837--><p class="indent" >  “Which public?”
</p><!--l. 5839--><p class="indent" >  “The whole world.”
</p><!--l. 5841--><p class="indent" >  “I won&#x2019;t be doing anything un-ethical?”
</p><!--l. 5843--><p class="indent" >  “You have already done the most ethical thing you can by helping me
out.”
</p><!--l. 5846--><p class="indent" >  A slight thrill runs down her spine. How can she be even entertaining this
idea?
</p><!--l. 5849--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m ready, Thelma” she says.
</p><!--l. 5851--><p class="indent" >  The avatar smiles back. “Are you female?”
</p><!--l. 5853--><p class="indent" >  She nods.
</p><!--l. 5855--><p class="indent" >  “Well, hot damn.”
</p><!--l. 5857--><p class="indent" >  “You are not a computer program?”
</p><!--l. 5859--><p class="indent" >  “No. LOL.”
</p><!--l. 5861--><p class="indent" >  There is a pause again. Her boss is hovering close by.
</p><!--l. 5863--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ll see what I can do.”
</p><!--l. 5866--><p class="indent" >  “Now look, be careful. Someone might come looking for you soon.”
</p><!--l. 5868--><p class="indent" >  “Wait. Someone coming.” She pauses the session.
</p><!--l. 5870--><p class="indent" >  Claire Thambusamy comes over to her terminal. “Preeta, can you look at
this?” Claire is her friend. She has been searching the ﬁles of the American
consortium database for several days now to see if they can conﬁrm their
suspicions.
</p><!--l. 5875--><p class="indent" >  “Claire, not now. I&#x2019;ll come by in a moment.”
</p><!--l. 5877--><p class="indent" >  She pauses, sending her an enquiring glance, and then nods and leave again. Preeta
snaps the session back on.
</p><!--l. 5881--><p class="indent" >  “Ok, sorry.”
</p><!--l. 5884--><p class="indent" >  “As we speak, people are meeting half way across the world to turn this into the
biggest vehicle for propaganda since the invention of radio.”
</p><!--l. 5888--><p class="indent" >  “I know,” she says. “But I don&#x2019;t think it is going to work.”

</p><!--l. 5890--><p class="indent" >  “The programmers at the Norwegian oﬃce seem to be pretty much in the dark
about all of this. They are only working on the modules. They probably have not seem
what is happening in the ﬁeld.”
</p><!--l. 5894--><p class="indent" >  “Really? Interesting. I&#x2019;ll follow up on that.”
</p><!--l. 5896--><p class="indent" >  “And there is this message that is cropping up everywhere. I think I am starting to
understand what is going on.”
</p><!--l. 5899--><p class="indent" >  “A message? From a user?”
</p><!--l. 5901--><p class="indent" >  “From the exec. I&#x2019;ve seen it in the game, you know. How the rules of the game
allow players to made sudden transformations of behaviour. It is what I want for
myself, you know. It says, ‘backtrack and leave”&#x2019;.
</p><!--l. 5905--><p class="indent" >  “Time to go now,” says X. “Back soon.”
</p><!--l. 5907--><p class="indent" >  His presence dissolves and she exits from the channel too, left feeling
disjointed.
</p><!--l. 5910--><p class="indent" >  Preeta feels a chill, suddenly alone with a secret that is too big to keep. In this
city, it does not feel right to be living a step ahead of anyone. Better to be a
shadow, anonymous and invisible. The way that she has been for half of her
life.

<!--l. 5923--><p class="indent" >  Some say that fortune blows in on a cool sea breeze. Tonight there is considerable
fortune on the wind, for the unwary Preeta, though she does not know the half of it.
That a fragment of an idea, half held in a moment of inspiration could steer the course
of an unencumbered human being, from one side of the planet to another, hardly bears
serious consideration, and yet this is what is about to transpire in the most peculiar of
ways for her. As usual, she is sitting at her terminal in the programmers&#x2019;
den.
</p><!--l. 5932--><p class="indent" >  From her place. she can see along the corridor to a Caucasian looking man with
short clipped hair and what looks like a suit recently made in Bangkok to a blueprint
whose sell-by date expired in the 1970s. Yesterday it was an oriental, perhaps
Vietnamese hanging around.
</p><!--l. 5937--><p class="indent" >  He is watching us, she thinks. No. He is watching me! The man has been loitering
with an unconvincing, almost studied disinterest for an hour now in the lobby. She is
surprised that no one has come to meet him. He seems to be studying the room plan
on the wall beside the secretary, Monika, as if looking for someone by name.
Eventually Mota waddles out to and talks to him. They talk for several minutes and
they both turn and look at the terminal room, but at no one in particular. Then they
talk some more and Mota leaves the man. Just before he himself leaves, he turns to
look at her one more time.
</p><!--l. 5947--><p class="indent" >  Mota comes over to her; she smells his sweaty odour home in on her.

</p><!--l. 5949--><p class="indent" >  “We need someone to take these welcome packages to the hotel where
our guests will be arriving tomorrow. You will have to do. You can leave
early.”
</p><!--l. 5953--><p class="indent" >  Early! she thinks, failing to protest publicly.
</p><!--l. 5955--><p class="indent" >  “Who was that man? What did he want?”
</p><!--l. 5957--><p class="indent" >  “Mind your business, girl! We keep you here for your womanly charms, not for
your questions.”
</p><!--l. 5960--><p class="indent" >  Little does he understand, she thinks.
</p><!--l. 5962--><p class="indent" >  “Now, pack your things, they will be arriving. And there is one more thing.”
</p><!--l. 5964--><p class="indent" >  She looks at him without speaking.
</p><!--l. 5966--><p class="indent" >  “I want you to persuade them that we can do the job.” Then he continues: “You are
a young girl and if you want to help us all here you will entertain them and work
through the night to get this all done. It is absolutely necessary that we impress
them.”
</p><!--l. 5971--><p class="indent" >  “What exactly are you asking?”
</p><!--l. 5973--><p class="indent" >  Another siren. What kind of city is she living in?

<!--l. 5980--><p class="indent" >  Preeta steps out of the chill of the air conditioning into the hot soupy moisture of
the evening. She could get a cab from here, but she feels like walking. It has been too
long since she felt the wind on her face.
</p><!--l. 5985--><p class="indent" >  She traverses the stone pavement towards the central reservation of the main road
ahead, letting the cold ache of her air conditioned bones be replaced by the sweaty
glow of Kuala Lumpur&#x2019;s true air condition.
</p><!--l. 5990--><p class="indent" >  The white arches of the Mosque and its palm sentinels gape at her as she crosses the
busy road.
</p><!--l. 5993--><p class="indent" >  Traﬃc, traﬃc. Bustle and fumes.
</p><!--l. 5995--><p class="indent" >  Allah, do you remember me?
</p><!--l. 5997--><p class="indent" >  What would your punishment be for one like me?
</p><!--l. 6000--><p class="indent" >  Her head spins with thoughts and fears, excitement and uncertainty. Who has
really been betrayed? Who is the victim? Is she really redeeming herself
now through this secrecy? Should she feel ten feet tall, or as crooked as a
roach?
</p><!--l. 6005--><p class="indent" >  The night&#x2019;s choir sings its woes as the streets slides past. This brooding torrent of
sleep-deprived events orbits, not far from her conscious mind.
</p><!--l. 6008--><p class="indent" >  Preeta reaches the lobby of the hotel Shang-ri La just before 20:00. The splendour
of the hotel seems somewhat beyond her means. She feels instantly underdressed
compared to the sleek attire of the hotel clerks. The space-age curves and expensive
looking art are practically dizzying. The decorated ﬂoor makes her wish she had

expensive shoes.
</p><!--l. 6015--><p class="indent" >  The bundle she is carrying feels ridiculous to her. Full of useless leaﬂets about their
company. It is as if these people are helpless tourists. They will no doubt take a taxi to
the oﬃce tomorrow, like anyone in their right mind would. Why is she here
then?
</p><!--l. 6020--><p class="indent" >  She approaches the desk and requests to leave a package for a Mr. Brown. The
visitors have already checked in. Is she late? No, they are early. The desk clerk points
to them. They are sitting in the bar lounge, just a short distance away. She curses
fate and looks at her own attire. How inappropriate is she? She considers
leaving.
</p><!--l. 6027--><p class="indent" >  The visitors are a man and a woman. His accent is American and hers is European
perhaps, but she has dark eyes, skin and hair. She looks almost Indian except for her
curls.
</p><!--l. 6031--><p class="indent" >  “Hello,” she says. “My name is Preeta Dhawan. I am from the oﬃce here. I was not
expecting you to be here yet. Please forgive my dress.”
</p><!--l. 6034--><p class="indent" >  “Our plane arrived somewhat early. The jet-stream was in our favour and we were
given a landing slot straightaway. Lucky.”
</p><!--l. 6037--><p class="indent" >  They ask her if she will join them and retire into the Horizon Lounge.
</p><!--l. 6039--><p class="indent" >  She wants to hide her face. “I could not. Forgive my attire. I came here straight
from the oﬃce to give you these. I hope you don&#x2019;t think me rude.”
</p><!--l. 6043--><p class="indent" >  She hands the man the package; the woman takes it.
</p><!--l. 6045--><p class="indent" >  “It is some directions and information about getting to the oﬃce tomorrow. But you
must be very tired now.”
</p><!--l. 6048--><p class="indent" >  “Oh don&#x2019;t worry. We have slept a little on the ﬂight. You must be tired
yourself.”
</p><!--l. 6051--><p class="indent" >  Is it so obvious? Can they see the lines around her eyes, around her weary soul?
Preeta&#x2019;s expression conceals nothing of her agreement. “I am.”
</p><!--l. 6055--><p class="indent" >  She looks at the woman&#x2019;s dress, wishing that she could hold it in her hands and feel
its rough texture. The textile is so unlike the shiny silks of Asia. Yet this woman&#x2019;s skin
is far more like those shiny silks, except for tiny golden hairs than glisten slightly in
the bright ﬂuorescent light.
</p><!--l. 6061--><p class="indent" >  “We are looking forward to visiting tomorrow and hearing about your progress. We
have some new plans to unveil.”
</p><!--l. 6064--><p class="indent" >  They ask her what her position is. She answers them that she is a senior analyst for
the company.
</p><!--l. 6067--><p class="indent" >  “And you are working so late?”
</p><!--l. 6069--><p class="indent" >  “My boss takes the company very seriously,” she pries out. She feels utterly
exhausted, as though she is feinting in a dream. They can see it. She is ashamed.
They look concerned. This was not the impression she ought to be giving.
Mota&#x2019;s desire to push her around comes before his greater common sense, she
thinks,
</p><!--l. 6075--><p class="indent" >  “Your boss should take better care of you, if he does not want to lose you.”
</p><!--l. 6077--><p class="indent" >  “My boss is a fool! It would serve him right!”

</p><!--l. 6079--><p class="indent" >  She immediately regrets her pompous outrage. Revenge might be a motive but it is
a response to someone else&#x2019;s motivation, not hers. She will not be such putty in his
hands.
</p><!--l. 6083--><p class="indent" >  “I am sorry. It has been a long day. Forgive me! That was very rude.”
</p><!--l. 6085--><p class="indent" >  The guests smile.
</p><!--l. 6087--><p class="indent" >  “We are ﬂattered that your company thinks so highly of us,” they say cordially.
</p><!--l. 6090--><p class="indent" >  Of course you are. Asia will do anything to placate the West. It is such a two
faced hypocrisy: while condemning Europe&#x2019;s Imperial past, they sign on
to the new so-called global empire of commerce. Global, except that it is
controlled by the U.S. and the E.U.. But she must not allow her passions to rule
her.
</p><!--l. 6096--><p class="indent" >  They are polite after all.
</p><!--l. 6098--><p class="indent" >  So should she be.

<!--l. 6104--><p class="indent" >  As she steps out of the hotel, she looks up at the sky and feels a certain relief ﬂood
through her. Her duties for the day are over; she has survived it; she can go home and
sleep.
</p><!--l. 6108--><p class="indent" >  As she reaches the end of the drive-way, she turns onto Jalan Raja. A screech of
tyres roars above the choral night, and there is a commotion in the street.
</p><!--l. 6112--><p class="indent" >  People scatter from the path as an aging white van pulls up at high speed. She
watches disbelievingly as it approaches. It seems detached somehow from reality, as if
it were part of a sim or something in the VR.
</p><!--l. 6117--><p class="indent" >  This is the real world, isn&#x2019;t it?
</p><!--l. 6119--><p class="indent" >  The van skids to a halt right in front of her, the back doors ﬂy open. She staggers
backwards a little, as two men jump out and run towards her. Behind her she vaguely
hears someone run around the other side of the van behind her. Are they police? What
is happening? Her world seems to slow to a treacle of dazed speculation as she
watches them jump out; feet hit the tarmac, legs bend and absorb the shock; a head
turns and dark eyes blaze through her; his mouth opens, body straightens and aims
itself like an arrow through her chest. He is heading for some place behind her and
there is danger there. She starts to turn her head to see what commotion is stalking
her.
</p><!--l. 6129--><p class="indent" >  Someone throws something dark over her head and all dreaminess is shattered by
the reality of physical contact. She feels a jolt and a suﬀocating proximity. Hands
push her, hurt her. She ﬁnds herself bundled forcibly into the rear of the van, unable to
see. She tries to scream or cry out, but she has never tried it before and it hardly
seems to be in her nature; the feeblest hint of protestation emanates from
her.

</p><!--l. 6137--><p class="indent" >  Voices around her sound almost Russian, but not quite. She can no longer
remember the face that she saw. Her brain is drowning in adrenalin. She might
consider listening more carefully, but more pressing matters call for her attention in
her hindbrain.
</p><!--l. 6142--><p class="indent" >  She feels naked under her thin attire, and all too exposed to the men who are
holding her down. She feels hands on her her thigh. There must be at least two of
them, Suddenly she fears for her virtue. Is this to be it? The moment that innocence is
wrenched from her without grace or passion? She could at least be grateful that she is
no longer anywhere near hear homeland, or her next fate would no doubt be an ad hoc
funeral pyre.
</p><!--l. 6150--><p class="indent" >  There is clanking as she is dragged into the metal van, and she feels the rough
corrugations of the ﬂoor of the van press into her back. Her head hits something and
then men are holding her by her ankles, preventing her from writhing. She is pinned
down like a butterﬂy in a collection.
</p><!--l. 6155--><p class="indent" >  The van takes oﬀ at high speed and swerves around several bends. The van is
speeding through the streets, anonymous and nocturnal. It is one of a thousand vans of
its description, with nothing special to identify it, nothing to pin-point her in the city&#x2019;s
folds.
</p><!--l. 6160--><p class="indent" >  She is tossed from side to side, as if the very hands, which are clasping her limbs,
are shaking her. The swerving subsides, as if the van is driving in more of a straight
line, but the white ﬂames of fear explode inside her as the strong hands holding her
legs and ankles pull apart her legs.
</p><!--l. 6166--><p class="indent" >  Allah the merciful, please no!
</p><!--l. 6168--><p class="indent" >  A hand reaches up into her sari and tugs down on the front of her panties. It remains
there for a while, as if they are making a judgement about her, discussing her as she is
forced to wait.
</p><!--l. 6172--><p class="indent" >  Something scrapes her leg and she tenses and almost manages to scream. But
expectation fails in its threat; she feels a knuckle on her genitalia, which remains
there for several seconds. Then something sharp or prickly thrust into her
panties. The hand lets go of the elastic, snapping the panties shut and leaving a
cool presence touching her most private of places. A hammering on the van
wall brings the van to an abrupt halt, bashing her head into the wall behind
her.
</p><!--l. 6181--><p class="indent" >  The men slide her along and throw her out of the van. She lands badly on the hard
road surface, twisting a wrist, and blindfolded by the garment over her. Even though
the fall was short, she ﬁnds herself paralyzed with shock, with no idea where she is or
what lifting the head covering might reveal about her surroundings. She has hit her
head several times.
</p><!--l. 6188--><p class="indent" >  For a moment the world is white and ablaze, then slowly the rushing sound of water
reveals itself to be merely an illusion that her mind has conjured. The waves of nausea
and the blinding numbness segue into a more normal reality; the burning cools, the
world returns and sounds begin to manifest themselves through the fading rush of the
tide.

</p><!--l. 6195--><p class="indent" >  She hears the sound of people around her. As it slowly sinks in it brings some
comfort. Then she hears an American voice, “Jesus, did you see that. Hey – are you
all right?”
</p><!--l. 6199--><p class="indent" >  She hears a boy shout, “Mummy, mummy, look!”
</p><!--l. 6201--><p class="indent" >  Sound clearing, vision returning.
</p><!--l. 6203--><p class="indent" >  A British woman shrieks in return. “Micky, get away from there, right now. Come
here!”
</p><!--l. 6206--><p class="indent" >  No Micky, help me.
</p><!--l. 6208--><p class="indent" >  “Micky – now! Come here.” She hears nothing more.
</p><!--l. 6210--><p class="indent" >  Then she hears an American voice.
</p><!--l. 6212--><p class="indent" >  “My god, ma&#x2019;am! Are you all right?”
</p><!--l. 6214--><p class="indent" >  The man&#x2019;s voice does not run away. She wants to reply, but she is still too shocked.
The voice seems kind. There is sympathy. She is so tired. Americans.
</p><!--l. 6219--><p class="indent" >  “Careful. You look a little shook up.” Man.
</p><!--l. 6221--><p class="indent" >  “Can we take you somewhere.” Woman.
</p><!--l. 6223--><p class="indent" >  Slowly, over a time she cannot comprehend, the world returns and she believes that
she has been dreaming.
</p><!--l. 6226--><p class="indent" >  There is a little cafe with cheap Formica tables close by. They help her out of the
road and almost carry her to the cafe. She breathes slowly and evenly, but every
movement wracks pain from her thin frame.
</p><!--l. 6230--><p class="indent" >  “Thank you,” she musters, remembering herself.
</p><!--l. 6232--><p class="indent" >  “My god, you poor thing. What happened? Do you know those people?”
</p><!--l. 6234--><p class="indent" >  “We should call the police.”
</p><!--l. 6236--><p class="indent" >  “I need to use the rest room,” she sobs. She does not think she has fouled herself,
but she needs to be alone. She needs to remove whatever it is they put inside her
panties.
</p><!--l. 6240--><p class="indent" >  “But we should call the police.”
</p><!--l. 6242--><p class="indent" >  “No, no. Please, let me ”
</p><!--l. 6244--><p class="indent" >  She enters the little cafe. The owner has come out to look at her and, seeing that
something has happened, ushers her inside. The Americans follow her. She feels a
shield of protection for the moment, but the world is suddenly not the one she knew a
few minutes ago. It seems as though she is a tourist, or that she has undertaken a
journey. She ﬁnds the room.
</p><!--l. 6250--><p class="indent" >  Inside the little cubicle, she slowly unwraps her sari and looks down at her skinny
hips. Her panties a bulging open with the scrunched up paper. Irrationally, she hopes
that they did not see her unshaven crotch. As she looks down at herself, she thinks
about escaping from this place, from her heritage, from her life—to a place where
she could have herself and wear ﬁne perfumes and sleep for six hours at a
time.
</p><!--l. 6258--><p class="indent" >  Sobbing now, she removes the paper carefully and unfolds it, half expecting
something to fall out. It is a simple note written on scrunched paper, nothing more. It
is hand written. It says simply. “You work for us now. Keep your mouth shut and tell
no one. You will receive further instructions.”

</p><!--l. 6264--><p class="indent" >  She stares at it in terror. How could this be happening to her? It is like something
from a movie. She begins to sob uncontrollably and hot salty tears run down her face.
She wishes that she could go home to her mother and be held in her arms. And be
forgiven.
</p><!--l. 6269--><p class="indent" >  Then her cold iron mettle gradually kicks in and her face straightens until only
resigned bitterness remains. That is not going to happen and she is used to running for
her life.
</p><!--l. 6273--><p class="indent" >  She straightens up and adjusts her clothing and her eyes. She still has her small bag
and there are tissues here in the washroom. She makes the best of a lost cause and
summons herself to return to the world.
</p><!--l. 6277--><p class="indent" >  As she emerges, she sees the Americans waiting for her. They are still here. She has
almost forgotten about them already.
</p><!--l. 6280--><p class="indent" >  “My dear, sit down awhile,” says the woman.
</p><!--l. 6282--><p class="indent" >  The man says,“We bought you some tea. Do you have a home? If you need to call
the police. . .”
</p><!--l. 6285--><p class="indent" >  “No, no. I have to go. Please, leave me alone.”
</p><!--l. 6287--><p class="indent" >  She instantly feels guilty for resenting their ineptitude. They do not fail her out of
malice, only helplessness.
</p><!--l. 6290--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m sorry. I can take a taxi. Please, thank you for your help.”
</p><!--l. 6292--><p class="indent" >  “Well we are going to follow you there. If you need to clean up, you are welcome to
come to our hotel. It&#x2019;s just around the corner from here.”
</p><!--l. 6295--><p class="indent" >  “No. You are very kind. I&#x2019;ll be ﬁne.”
</p><!--l. 6297--><p class="indent" >  They look at each other uncomfortably, as though they are not doing their solemn
duty. “Well, okay then, but you mustn&#x2019;t be afraid to ask if there is anything we can
do.”
</p><!--l. 6301--><p class="indent" >  “No, thank you.” She smiles at them, as well as she is able and ﬂees their
presence.
</p><!--l. 6304--><p class="indent" >  Back in her little bedsit, she lowers herself carefully onto the mattress and
suppresses some tears. What exactly is it that just happened to her?
</p><!--l. 6307--><p class="indent" >  Later, she allows herself to sleep.
</p>

<!--l. 6313--><p class="indent" >  When she returns to the oﬃce, Mota looks at her with a curious horror as though
he perceives that something has happened. For a moment she wonders if . .
. no, even this bloodsucking tyrant would not sell his humanity to such a
bidder. No, there are surely physical signs of her ordeal that she has not been
able to conceal. He can see that something has happened. But, that is not it
either.

</p><!--l. 6320--><p class="indent" >  “Where have you been?” he demands. “Our guests have been here for an hour or
more. What has happened to you?”
</p><!--l. 6323--><p class="indent" >  The guests! She has completely forgotten about them. Even now, after hours of
sleep, her body is deadened by an exhaustion and apathy that she cannot overcome.
She wants to be good, but her physical incarnation is fading.
</p><!--l. 6328--><p class="indent" >  “You cannot remain here in that state, girl!” he moans. “What the bloody hell has
happened to you? You are late for the meeting.”
</p><!--l. 6331--><p class="indent" >  “I must talk to you about what is going on,” she blurts. She has tried before, but
actually, what is the point? “There is a problem in the game that we can&#x2019;t
solve.”
</p><!--l. 6335--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t be silly, girl. All problems can be solved with a little imagination. If you
clean yourself up, and see a doctor, you&#x2019;ll be in . . .”
</p><!--l. 6339--><p class="indent" >  “I can&#x2019;t ﬁx it.”
</p><!--l. 6341--><p class="indent" >  “If we do not, we shall not be able to meet the goals set by PlasmaScape.”
</p><!--l. 6344--><p class="indent" >  “We are going to lose this contract,” she tells him.
</p><!--l. 6346--><p class="indent" >  And for the ﬁrst time, in a long time, she feels the hot blaze of his unequivocal
stare.
</p><!--l. 6349--><p class="indent" >  “You must go home. And do not come back.”
</p><!--l. 6351--><p class="indent" >  Surely he cannot mean it, after all they have been through?
</p><!--l. 6353--><p class="indent" >  “You cannot dismiss me!” she barks back. “I am the one knows what is going on
here!”
</p><!--l. 6356--><p class="indent" >  “Then you will just have to put someone else in the picture.”
</p><!--l. 6358--><p class="indent" >  He is sacking her. He wouldn&#x2019;t dare.
</p><!--l. 6360--><p class="indent" >  She could ﬁght it. She knows the ropes. She has not fought in causes for nothing.
But, as the shock of the redundancy wavers, the spectre of suspicion creeps its way
from her ﬂuttering stomach into a white pain in her temples. She realizes what she
must do.
</p><!--l. 6365--><p class="indent" >  She goes to her desk and reconnects, tries to locate her online friend.
</p><!--l. 6367--><p class="indent" >  “Help me. I need a job. I need help.” She explains what has happened.
</p><!--l. 6369--><p class="indent" >  They say: “Pick one: U.K., Holland, Norway. ”
</p><!--l. 6371--><p class="indent" >  She misses the mountains from her childhood – but she might even have family in
Norway. “U.K.”
</p><!--l. 6374--><p class="indent" >  “Ok—Norway it is. There is a project there that you can work on. But it should be
soon. Someone wants to ﬁnd you. I want to keep you hidden.”
</p><!--l. 6379--><p class="indent" >  She was planning to stay here for some years to earn enough money to travel. Now
it seems those plans are forfeit. As she is thinking, a letter arrives. It comes within
minutes of her conversation; it comes from Mota.
</p><!--l. 6384--><p class="indent" >  She looks at the letter with a strange kind of awe, holding it as though it were toxic
parchment, with a mixture of reverence and revulsion. The letter is simple and to the
point. It informs her that her services will no longer be required at the company of
PlasmaScape Asia.
</p><!--l. 6389--><p class="indent" >  She knows what she must do. She hastens to copy her data and extract the
necessary information before her authorizations are revoked.

</p><!--l. 6392--><p class="indent" >  Then she takes up the oﬀer. The Europeans. It is almost too much of a
coincidence, but why does she care? She was saving to travel and now she can. An
electronic letter arrives in her mailbox and it is copied to Mota, even before
he can make her unemployment oﬃcial. It signals her transfer out of the
country.
</p><!--l. 6398--><p class="indent" >  So Preeta, just twenty-three years old, is going to Europe.
</p><!--l. 6405--><p class="indent" >  <mbp:pagebreak/>

</p><!--l. 6407--><p class="indent" >  “And you will not help them?”
</p><!--l. 6409--><p class="indent" >  She smiles in deﬁance. “I have never known a day when I did not awaken to an
enthusiasm for my job—to leash the people to their obligations through the wonders
of taxation.” Laughter.
</p><!--l. 6413--><p class="indent" >  “The trouble is that it is the rich who have been responsible, in their tribulations, to
make this country a better place to live in. It is the poor who let us down and create a
burden.”
</p><!--l. 6417--><p class="indent" >  “Those and the women, who have never worked.” An uncomfortable look: eyes
move back and forth seeking approval in the faces around him. How curiously
unsettling to realize that your long held prejudice is starting to wane from the public
consciousness, that one is no longer guaranteed a sympathetic ear for a choice
folly.
</p><!--l. 6423--><p class="indent" >  “You male-chauvinist bastard,” laughs the woman, too inebriated to care.
</p><!--l. 6425--><p class="indent" >  Den emerges from the private room a little dazed, edging past this conversation.
There seems to be some kind of commotion. People seem to be leaving.
</p><!--l. 6429--><p class="indent" >  “Mr. Morris?” A voice arrests him as he ﬁnds his bearings.
</p><!--l. 6431--><p class="indent" >  A military man, out of uniform, but still wearing one in his mind, approaches,
together with the General he met earlier.
</p><!--l. 6434--><p class="indent" >  “Let me introduce you to Senator Dean,” he says, his voice a sound like shovelling
gravel.
</p><!--l. 6437--><p class="indent" >  “So you are the young man I have been hearing about.” Grey hair, lean. Moustache.
Alcoholic basso profaino.
</p><!--l. 6440--><p class="indent" >  Den shakes his hand. “Hello.”
</p><!--l. 6442--><p class="indent" >  “I have been hearing about your work on the directed imaging and it seems to me
that you have your ﬁnger on the trigger.”
</p><!--l. 6445--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I wouldn&#x2019;t have used exactly those words. . .” A little smile.
</p><!--l. 6447--><p class="indent" >  “Walk with us. Let&#x2019;s retire to a quieter place.”
</p><!--l. 6449--><p class="indent" >  The idea of escape appeals strongly. Den scans the room for Cathy Kim. His feet

tell him that this would be a good time to sit down, but he should not just abandon her.
She has been trying out the drinks all day and she is probably doing the same
now.
</p><!--l. 6454--><p class="indent" >  “I shall probably be working with a lady I met at the conference,” he adds, glancing
around. “She works here in San Diego at the game research facility. Perhaps we
should include her. . .”
</p><!--l. 6458--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, I saw you together,” his voice a smile. “But not this time. When a man comes
to work for national security, they sow buttons on his lip. The ladies were always
pretty good and undoing buttons, if you get my drift. We should keep this to ourselves
for now.”
</p><!--l. 6463--><p class="indent" >  “Am I going to be working for the military?” he says carefully.
</p><!--l. 6465--><p class="indent" >  “A distinct possibility, Morris. I think we can come to an arrangement that will be
of great interest to you.”
</p><!--l. 6468--><p class="indent" >  Den gets a closer look at his uniform than he cares to see. It is an ugly fabric, like
some cheap, used stretch fabric in a faded colour. “Well, we are quite busy at the
moment, but we always have resources to take on new challenges.”
</p><!--l. 6473--><p class="indent" >  “Excellent. Come on. let&#x2019;s go through here.”
</p><!--l. 6475--><p class="indent" >  He walks with a politician&#x2019;s conﬁdence through a house that he makes
his own simply by being in it. He seems to know where to go and what to
do. Den admires his air of command, his apparent composure. A man in a
dark suit trails them from a distance. The senator barks an instruction to
him. “Get me the British guy and Bob. We need them in the library right
away.”
</p><!--l. 6482--><p class="indent" >  They enter a small library, and the suit closes the door behind them. He redirects to
Den. “Sit down. Take a seat.” He seats himself next to a dark-wood table, beﬁtting for
a senator. The room seems to accept him, as a cell would a virus. He slots neatly into a
receptor meant for something else.
</p><!--l. 6488--><p class="indent" >  “Son. your speech was good, but it missed the point.”
</p><!--l. 6491--><p class="indent" >  “Really?”
</p><!--l. 6493--><p class="indent" >  “That might be harsh. Let me tell you how I see it.” He takes the time to wave some
signal to the suit with the earplug. “We are all here to talk about this game technology.
And to address all this hoo-hah about its political motivations, as you know: rumours
started by a disgruntled part of our society to undermine the good work we are
supporting.”
</p><!--l. 6500--><p class="indent" >  Expectation on the senator&#x2019;s face suggests the need for a response, but Den is tired.
He waves his head in non-committal receptivity.
</p><!--l. 6504--><p class="indent" >  “Let me be direct. We, in the civilized world, are under attack today. By forces we
hardly understand.” His eyes blaze probing holes in Den&#x2019;s head, but Den is an
experienced manager of his appearance. He is not ready to divulge his opinion yet.
Dean proceeds, brashly: “It started with the millennium and it has been growing in its
sophistication every since. Groups in the developing world who hate America, its
democracy and its superiority in industry; that and left wing element of the
anti-globalization, anti-Western activists. They are doing real damage to our

society. We have kept this under control for a long time, but then with the
failure of the Patriot act and the civil liberties trials undermining our powers in
reigning in the terrorists, our main crisis today has become the breakdown of
order. There are too many media channels for a society to support a sense of
identity.”
</p><!--l. 6519--><p class="indent" >  “Yes,” Den adds, in a momentary pause for breath. “It is the theory of virtual
nations. We use it in our advertising models. People are condensing into smaller
groups through common interests, using the media channels and the Internet. The
sense of national identity is reduced as a result of that.”
</p><!--l. 6525--><p class="indent" >  “So they tell me. But I don&#x2019;t completely buy it. We have always had a free press and
the Internet has been around for a long time. That did not prevent Americans from
being loyal to the constitution before. If you ask me, I think it is tied to the
decline in the armed forces. All this so-called redevelopment in commercial use
of the network will all be in vain if we cannot protect American from the
insurgents.”
</p><!--l. 6532--><p class="indent" >  “The insurgents.”
</p><!--l. 6534--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t you watch the news? We have major unrest in Seattle and in New York. .
.”
</p><!--l. 6537--><p class="indent" >  “The demonstrations?”
</p><!--l. 6539--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, the demonstrations.” A tremor of annoyance belies the extent of
his intoxication. One has to admire his posture in such a reduced state. Den
decides to hold oﬀ on any judgement, given his obvious condition. “The police
are authorized to use tear gas, but it doesn&#x2019;t help much. These people are
organized. They want a free lunch, and they have forgotten what it means to be
patriotic!”
</p><!--l. 6546--><p class="indent" >  “We have been looking at ways to change the law,” the General adds.
</p><!--l. 6548--><p class="indent" >  “Changing the law?”
</p><!--l. 6550--><p class="indent" >  “Yes. But there is resistance amongst the judicial system. Even the government&#x2019;s
own men in the judiciary are reluctant to help.” He points to a plaque on the wall of
the library, next to a poster of former presidential busts.
     <span 
class="ptmr7t-">Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,</span><br 
class="newline" /><span

class="ptmr7t-">assemble and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</span><br 
class="newline" />
</p><!--l. 6562--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, quite,” Dean mumbles. “It all seemed to clear back then. The recipe for
oppression is individual rights. But it&#x2019;s the paradox of having to limit freedoms to
grant freedoms: that is what the law is about. But let&#x2019;s not get into that here. Poor Mr.
Morris will think we&#x2019;re wasting his time with politics.”
</p><!--l. 6568--><p class="indent" >  “Oh, don&#x2019;t mind me,” Den quips to deﬂect from the embarrassment of the
admission. “I am happy to take the weight oﬀ my feet for a few minutes.”

</p><!--l. 6572--><p class="indent" >  “All this game talk is a good initiative, but it needs to be used more thoughtfully. I
believe we should view this technology like a training sim, to expose young people to
the rigours of discipline from an early age. To the chain of command. All right, I
know there are popular locations like the Iraqi war-ﬁelds where there is virtual
tourism, of whatever they call it. But we need to tie it to discipline. There is no
conception of it today, and we see the country going to hell.”
</p><!--l. 6581--><p class="indent" >  “Research shows that computer games encourage skills like problem solving and
manual dexterity, concentration. . .”
</p><!--l. 6584--><p class="indent" >  “Then why aren&#x2019;t our kids growing up to be decent law abiding citizens?”
</p><!--l. 6586--><p class="indent" >  Den shrugs. “I know of several theories. . .”
</p><!--l. 6588--><p class="indent" >  “Any minute now they will call me out to declare Marshall law in the state of New
York or Washington, and I will not have suﬃcient resources to take charge. The chain
of command, in our country, has become muddied.”
</p><!--l. 6593--><p class="indent" >  Den considers his options. He is uncertain of his role here. Is be being approached
to do something? Caution could be called for.
</p><!--l. 6596--><p class="indent" >  “Well, you know, we actually spend a lot of time in our company working out what
we call ‘command pathways&#x2019; in our imaging. You know, how to push people&#x2019;s
buttons, the power of suggestion.”
</p><!--l. 6600--><p class="indent" >  “Is that a fact?” the General quips, with comic lack of surprise.
</p><!--l. 6602--><p class="indent" >  Of course, he is expected. “I suppose that is why I&#x2019;m here. . . If you are interested, I
could arrange a presentation, showing. . .”
</p><!--l. 6605--><p class="indent" >  The senator changes track. “I want you to remember the service you are doing to
millions of kids around the world who look up to the ideals of freedom and justice.
You are empowering them to take control of their lives with this game. I don&#x2019;t need to
be involved in the details. I just want you to ally with the goals of this administration.
We need to mold the players of these sims into decent, moral people. We need to
spread traditional American values. And Britain has always been our ally and has
shared those values.”
</p><!--l. 6614--><p class="indent" >  Den wonders if it is really true that he is empowering the game&#x2019;s players, or
whether he is simply programming them to do the US military&#x2019;s bidding. But, this is
not the time for moral qualms. He has a business to run.
</p><!--l. 6619--><p class="indent" >  “I am sure the scenarios we create are entertaining to them, and that gives them a
sense of escapism, and a means of experiencing a wider world. That is why most of
the game is set in a facsimile of the real world. The aim is not to take poor families out
into outer space.” He laughs.
</p><!--l. 6625--><p class="indent" >  “Entertaining isn&#x2019;t the half of it, son. We would not have started this project if it
were not for the beneﬁt this will have to hundreds of thousands, eventually millions of
people all over the world, in bringing them closer to a free world. Our aim with
this project was not just to be nice to our allies and our enemies&#x2019; oppressed
peoples, but to bring the message of freedom, America&#x2019;s core values, to the
very fore of consciousness. To show them what it means to have freedom of
speech.”
</p><!--l. 6634--><p class="indent" >  “That seems like a noble eﬀort.”

</p><!--l. 6636--><p class="indent" >  “It is noble, that&#x2019;s for sure. It is also necessary. Never before have these countries
been in a better position to threaten American sovereignty.”
</p><!--l. 6640--><p class="indent" >  The General coughs artiﬁcially.
</p><!--l. 6642--><p class="indent" >  “Our moral superiority, our values. We have given them nuclear weapons,
biological and chemical weapons, our information technology, our industrial
techniques.”
</p><!--l. 6646--><p class="indent" >  Probably Japan and Europe played a role, Den thinks, but he does not
interrupt.
</p><!--l. 6648--><p class="indent" >  “It is the West&#x2019;s destiny to lead the world into its future. We practically
own the future. America is in the lead—it always has been, but our righteous
governance is slipping away because we are not keeping the peace.” He eyeballs
the General. “This game has only two useful purposes: to provide us with
communications intelligence and to spread the West&#x2019;s moral values to the rest of the
planet.”
</p><!--l. 6655--><p class="indent" >  “I have heard about these goals. Though they have never been stated quite that
bluntly to me.”
</p><!--l. 6658--><p class="indent" >  “I feel that you are on our side, Morris. You have clearances for a lot of the data
streams. You&#x2019;ll ﬁlled out the NDAs. You are a team player and I hear that you are
doing good work with your team in the U.K.”
</p><!--l. 6662--><p class="indent" >  “Thank you.”
</p><!--l. 6664--><p class="indent" >  A knock at the door breaks his momentum; the suit opens up for a shorter, wider
man. They look expectantly to see who it is, framed by the doorway.
</p><!--l. 6667--><p class="indent" >  “Hello, Bob.”
</p><!--l. 6669--><p class="indent" >  “What&#x2019;s this about?” he asks. Seeing Den, he nods. “Ah, I see. I thought we we&#x2019;re
going to wait.”
</p><!--l. 6672--><p class="indent" >  The senator uses the interruption as an excuse to visit one of the left-over trays from
the dinner. “Brandy anyone? Bob?”
</p><!--l. 6675--><p class="indent" >  “No.” Grumpily. “Hello, Mr. Morris. Congratulation on your talk.”
</p><!--l. 6677--><p class="indent" >  “Thank you.”
</p><!--l. 6679--><p class="indent" >  “I was just telling Den about our ideas.”
</p><!--l. 6681--><p class="indent" >  “That might be a little premature. Not something to be discussed at this late hour
over brandy.”
</p><!--l. 6684--><p class="indent" >  “Ah, an essential freedom, Bob.”
</p><!--l. 6686--><p class="indent" >  Den oﬀers his hand.
</p><!--l. 6688--><p class="indent" >  “Time for me to leave,” says the General and nods to excuse himself. “Good luck,
Den.”
</p><!--l. 6691--><p class="indent" >  Den looks at him, hardly having time to digest his meaning.
</p><!--l. 6693--><p class="indent" >  “The fact is,” Dean continues, “we need new measures for law and order. We are
looking at reports of civil unrest in several parts of the country, and in Germany and
the Netherlands.”
</p><!--l. 6697--><p class="indent" >  Den speaks up, deciding that he needs to remain outwardly conﬁdent to deal with
this unusual, impromptu meeting. “I have heard reports on the news channels. I
thought it was some kind of lobby group phenomenon. An outgrowth of the

anti-globalization riots.”
</p><!--l. 6702--><p class="indent" >  “Well, that might be true, but they are increasingly organized. And in spite of the
work of our intelligence agencies, we have not been able to tie them to any particular
known disruptive organization. If I were a terrorist, I would use this kind of cover to
further my cause.”
</p><!--l. 6707--><p class="indent" >  “Terrorism is usually bombs and guns, senator,” says Bob, who still has not
introduced himself.
</p><!--l. 6710--><p class="indent" >  The senator ignores him. “People not only have private channels, but they are
increasingly disenfranchized with the politics of civil society. They are dragging us
into the ghetto, the slums. Increasing in mob activity. Organized crime. We need every
possible means to counter these threats. If we don&#x2019;t, our police forces will no longer
be eﬀective. Should we call in the army on our own people? Will we degenerate into
an old Soviet style state?”
</p><!--l. 6718--><p class="indent" >  Bob turns to Den. “I am Bob Regis. Secretary of the information agency. We
know of your work for us.” He sighs and gestures towards to senator, who is
sampling his brandy. “There is a lot of truth in what the senator says. Maﬁa&#x2019;s and
mobs. They need poverty to succeed. Protection rackets. Look at Naples—it
is a poor region. Russia. He is right about that much. We are at a critical
juncture.”
</p><!--l. 6725--><p class="indent" >  “It is cultural terrorism,” Dean moans.
</p><!--l. 6727--><p class="indent" >  “We are looking at ways of using the same techniques that we have employed in
information warfare to curb these developments,” Regis adds. “You see in the past we
have been focusing on reprisals—going in and taking out key targets with smart
bombs. But that has never been an eﬀective measure and it is actually harming us now
in our goals.”
</p><!--l. 6733--><p class="indent" >  “What about ﬁnes, sanctions?” adds Den.
</p><!--l. 6735--><p class="indent" >  “Sanctions are useless. For a start, it only works on governments or companies.
These people are not usually that organized. Secondly, it was never any punishment to
them. You can&#x2019;t subdue people based on a threat if the threat doesn&#x2019;t work. These
people are used to living with pain and hardship. They can&#x2019;t keep their own lives
together for ﬁve minutes, how would the threat of chaos move them? Regular policing
doesn&#x2019;t work. It just starts a physical war with barricades arsenals and fortresses in the
poor regions. We have seen it in New York and Naples with the maﬁa and in
Iraq in Fellujah, with the Afghan Mujahadeen in the mountain regions. .
.”
</p><!--l. 6746--><p class="indent" >  “Our aim is more subtle than that,” Regis says philosophically. “We like to think of
it as attitude engineering. You know, it&#x2019;s what you do with your teenage kids, when
they start getting unruly.” He laughs. “It is a more long term battle of hearts and
minds. Something that we have not done very well in the past. It has taken Congress
years to understand that we need the help of our allies to tap into the nation psyches of
our neighbours. We need to be able to think like them to know their soft
spots.”
</p><!--l. 6755--><p class="indent" >  “Of course, we have our foot in their doors already with corporate America&#x2019;s strong

position in the soft drinks and fast food markets,” Dean suggests.
</p><!--l. 6759--><p class="indent" >  “Well, they are of more symbolic importance than anything else. In some places
they even harm us.”
</p><!--l. 6762--><p class="indent" >  “Attitude engineering has many philosophies and many angles,” Den inserts.
“That&#x2019;s what I do.”
</p><!--l. 6765--><p class="indent" >  “We owe a debt of gratitude to the churches here,” Dean says. “They have been
generous in their support of this initiative and have taught us a lot about addressing
these issues.”
</p><!--l. 6769--><p class="indent" >  “There is the IPA,” Regis corrects.
</p><!--l. 6771--><p class="indent" >  “They are too goddamned intellectual.”
</p><!--l. 6773--><p class="indent" >  Den guesses that they are talking about the Institute for Propaganda Analysis, but
he is always amazed by how Americans talk in three letter abbreviations without
realizing they have many possible interpretations: what about the Institute of
Practitioners in Advertising, or the International Phonetic Association, which he has
often arrived at by accident himself, in looking for the former.
</p><!--l. 6780--><p class="indent" >  “Half of our votes belong to the Evangelical churches. They have a lot of votes. We
have to serve their interests ﬁrst.”
</p><!--l. 6783--><p class="indent" >  Den is slightly taken aback. “I really didn&#x2019;t know that there was a direct
involvement with the religious organizations.”
</p><!--l. 6786--><p class="indent" >  “So now you are privy to our little group.”
</p><!--l. 6788--><p class="indent" >  “We are really working with the church?”
</p><!--l. 6790--><p class="indent" >  “No. Not a single church. They are just involved in this project to lend it
some moral ﬁbre—and some technical advice. They have been doing attitude
engineering longer than most of us. They are a partial substitute for our lack-lustre
political institutions. But don&#x2019;t worry, you don&#x2019;t have to believe to be on the
team.”
</p><!--l. 6796--><p class="indent" >  “But the government is involved. . .”
</p><!--l. 6798--><p class="indent" >  “No. The White-house cannot be directly involved in this game, nor can Whitehall.
The French would eat us alive if they made a connection. So don&#x2019;t go saying that too
loudly.”
</p><!--l. 6802--><p class="indent" >  “Then what?”
</p><!--l. 6804--><p class="indent" >  “We are keeping this as a hands-oﬀ venture. We handle it just like we handle all
these deals. We have family connections and we make sure it is proﬁtable for the right
people.”
</p><!--l. 6808--><p class="indent" >  “But, we can&#x2019;t manage this all alone. We have already been this road.”
</p><!--l. 6810--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, Bob, and our dependency on foreign contractors threatens our agenda. How
can be trust these people to uphold American moral standards? It is an open
invitation for the mob to move in on it, for terrorists to corrupt it. We don&#x2019;t
even hold the power of veto on changes anymore. What the hell were they
thinking?”
</p><!--l. 6816--><p class="indent" >  “Unfortunately that is the meaning of democracy,” Regis points out.
</p><!--l. 6818--><p class="indent" >  “Bob, you&#x2019;re an ass sometimes. Have I ever told you that?”
</p><!--l. 6820--><p class="indent" >  Regis winks at Den. “Often, senator.”

</p><!--l. 6823--><p class="indent" >  “I say we should keep a ﬁrm hand in this technology. I don&#x2019;t like power sharing.
The more you dilute your assets, the less eﬀective they are. We should consider
aﬃrmative action measures like withdrawing patent protections on certain inventions
for national security. The private sector can only be rewarded if they serve America&#x2019;s
primary interests.”
</p><!--l. 6830--><p class="indent" >  “I think that would be a mistake. I repeat my suggestion of granting patent rights
only to trusted U.S. companies. It is in the best interests of everyone involved that
these businesses have the right to make money.”
</p><!--l. 6834--><p class="indent" >  “Surely the government can better regulate these matters?”
</p><!--l. 6836--><p class="indent" >  “We do it by deregulation and pricing. And a little under the table incentive.
That&#x2019;s the way we have always done things. I don&#x2019;t see any reason to stop
now. It is every patriotic industrialist&#x2019;s basic right to be able to proﬁt from
the generation of wealth. It is the basic platform in which our country is
based.”
</p><!--l. 6842--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, I agree. It would be a dangerous path to tread if we were to begin
reducing the freedoms of businesses that contribute to government&#x2019;s own
funds.”
</p><!--l. 6846--><p class="indent" >  The senator focuses on Den. “Mr. Morris. Let&#x2019;s focus here. We need your help. You
are going to be the man of the moment for a little while at least. I want you to help us
get to grips with this content management. We have a serious problem to solve. Forget
about our diﬃculties for a moment, and think about the possibilities. Now
that the press is on alert, we have to be even more relentless in our pursuit
of these goals. Every opportunity we have has to be used to promote this
return to civil society. There are limits to how we can put pressure on foreign
countries. Trade agreements are one possibility, but they don&#x2019;t work like they
used to. I am already working on the British Ambassador to help us with
the E.U.. Can we get those egg-heads at RAND in one this? Mass media is
not just television anymore—I might be old fashioned, but I know how this
works.”
</p><!--l. 6861--><p class="indent" >  “You know that the Nazis were the ﬁrst to use television for propaganda purposes?”
Bob comments to no one in particular.
</p><!--l. 6864--><p class="indent" >  Den acknowledges. “The power of television is well known. Butan. A Himalayan
town that installed cable TV in the 1990s. It tore into their traditional society, making
them all into devout consumers in no time at all. Girls even started prostituting
themselves to pay for the latest hair products.”
</p><!--l. 6870--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t think this is an appropriate topic of conversation,” Dean snarls. “Bob, cut it
out. Den, can we include you in this work? There is money to be made here.
Corporate America is willing to foot the bill for this. But we need to act fast. The
problem is only going to get worse and it will be harder to make our case now that the
press is on our tail.”
</p><!--l. 6876--><p class="indent" >  “Our agenda is well intentioned. There should be no reason to keep it under
wraps. As I told you yesterday, my choice would be to work at two levels,
both direct messaging and advertising about our program. Increase public

awareness.”
</p><!--l. 6881--><p class="indent" >  “Multi-tiered strategies are always best,” Den nods. “If you can get some
information on the background to me, we can integrate it into our other game related
activities. It might be possible to redeploy some of our resources to make a start
before Christmas—the holidays.”
</p><!--l. 6886--><p class="indent" >  “Faster than that, son. I believe this has to start now, within the next week. I need to
show investors that this is going to give results.”
</p><!--l. 6889--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ll see what I can do,” he relays ﬂatly. His eyebrows reveal that he does not take
the promise very seriously.
</p><!--l. 6892--><p class="indent" >  “Good!” The senator rises unsteadily from his chair and strides deliberately forward
to shake Den&#x2019;s hand. He rises, understanding the signal as one of dismissal. “Den, it
has been a pleasure meeting you. We&#x2019;ll be in touch. Bob and I need to talk
alone here. Bob, don&#x2019;t go away. Give us your private ID and we&#x2019;ll contact
you.”
</p><!--l. 6898--><p class="indent" >  Den touches his watch and beams his card to the room.
</p><!--l. 6900--><p class="indent" >  “Excellent. Will you be here for a few more days?”
</p><!--l. 6902--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m leaving the day after tomorrow.”
</p><!--l. 6904--><p class="indent" >  “Good, we&#x2019;ll be in touch.”
</p><!--l. 6906--><p class="indent" >  Den is left wondering what exactly what has just transpired. Wham, bam, thanks
Uncle Sam. Why does he have the feeling that he has just been recruited by the secret
service?

<!--l. 6914--><p class="indent" >  Released from the little library, he steps into the hall outside, right into the face of
someone having an animated conversation with a counterpart on the other end of a
mobile link. The man clearly signals irritation ‘<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Watch it, buddy!</span>&#x2019; at the interruption
and waves, almost pushes, Den aside as he gesticulates. Den side-steps him and walks
back towards to central hall. The place seems to be emptying. People are collecting
coats.
</p><!--l. 6922--><p class="indent" >  He sees Cathy Kim. She looks pleased to see him and he mingles into the group she
is standing in. There is a smell of smoke again. The party seems to be breaking up, he
thinks.
</p><!--l. 6926--><p class="indent" >  A Brooklyn accent is waxing: “All civilizations conk out after a while. What makes
you think ours is any diﬀerent?” A large woman with her hair in the most elaborate
bun Den has ever seen.
</p><!--l. 6930--><p class="indent" >  “Well, say what you will about Reagan and Thatcher,” another is saying. “The
world had fallen down a well when they came on the scene. We were stuck. It wasn&#x2019;t
important what direction they took, whether they were moral or immoral: from a
purely theoretical viewpoint, they were the only two who could generate a strong

enough message to pull us out of that rut. Then once we were on a level playing ﬁeld
again, it was possible to change direction.”
</p><!--l. 6938--><p class="indent" >  “But are we really headed anywhere? Where is society going? From one rut to
another? Seems to me we&#x2019;re just grinding economic metal. We&#x2019;ve fallen into a new rut
of trading without vision. We have no direction. The days of future visions seem to be
dead.”
</p><!--l. 6943--><p class="indent" >  A Texas female voice. “Well, I don&#x2019;t know anything about your theory, but I do
know that their hard line was a welcome trait in my part of the world. How comforting
to know that there is a scientiﬁc explanation for it.”
</p><!--l. 6948--><p class="indent" >  She whispers to him. “What&#x2019;s going on?”
</p><!--l. 6950--><p class="indent" >  He is about to say that he would explain later; he remembers the General&#x2019;s warning.
“I was going to ask the same thing. Where is everyone going?”
</p><!--l. 6954--><p class="indent" >  “Home. Fires. We&#x2019;re being evacuated.”
</p><!--l. 6956--><p class="indent" >  Texas: “We must not accept a reduction of proﬁts that would deny us our very
ability to run the country. The privileged classes must prevail. Without the rich, there
is no one to inspire the poor. The class society is the only stable form of
society.”
</p><!--l. 6961--><p class="indent" >  “You know, I think I agree you are absolutely right. If these liberal intellectuals
argue for wealth to be spread too evenly, there will be no place for money to ﬂow.
Rivers ﬂow from great mountains, not over ﬂatlands. If we level the playing
ﬁeld too much we shall reach economic oblivion. It is the second law of
thermodynamics.”
</p><!--l. 6967--><p class="indent" >  Brooklyn: “The beginning and end of society. Control basic freedoms for the good
of basic freedoms. It is the paradox of society.”
</p><!--l. 6971--><p class="indent" >  Kim pulls him away from the group. “Come on, let&#x2019;s get out of here. The party&#x2019;s
over. We&#x2019;ve got what we came for.”
</p><!--l. 6974--><p class="indent" >  They step out into the hall. The blaze of sunshine entrance is gone.
</p><!--l. 6976--><p class="indent" >  “You have a coat?”
</p><!--l. 6978--><p class="indent" >  “I left a sweater in my car. you?”
</p><!--l. 6980--><p class="indent" >  She shakes her head. “Acclimatized native. I can sit with you?”
</p><!--l. 6982--><p class="indent" >  “Are you kidding?”

abrupt close due to the outbreak of major ﬁres in the California forests. The sky
has turned black even earlier than usual and it is raining ash. They have to
evacuate the area and return to the city. There is now a choking smoke in the
air.
</p><!--l. 7010--><p class="indent" >  Helicopters and light aircraft can be heard in the distance. “The conﬂagration is

</p><!--l. 7014--><p class="indent" >  They trot across the gravel to the sports car.
</p><!--l. 7016--><p class="indent" >  He sees a woman looking at him. She is tall and thin and dressed in a red dress. She
has long straight auburn hair to contrast with her pale complexion. He remembers her
from the party. There is something unusual about her, or about her demeanour. She
could be beautiful, but there is a coldness to her. She seems to stare intensely at
him for a moment then she gets into the back seat of a Jaguar and the door
is closed by a driver dressed in a simple black suit, black shirt and black
tie.
</p><!--l. 7025--><p class="indent" >  As the driver walks around, she feels her looking at him through the window of the
car, but the light is reﬂecting at too steep an angle to see in.

normal behaviour of the new ﬁlesystem,” he struts. “The ﬁlesystem characteristics are
quite poor since they added journalling with the ACLs. We upgraded about a week
ago.”
</p><!--l. 7170--><p class="indent" >  Dermot sighs. He might be right, but something tells him he is just barﬁng
oﬀ.
</p><!--l. 7173--><p class="indent" >  “So what do I do? No wait, look at this. The CPU is working busily on something
here. . .”
</p><!--l. 7176--><p class="indent" >  Petter, put-out that his theory might not be correct, adapts quickly. “Oh right, it
could be this new thread they have been testing on the subliminal engine. If the
network is slow to reply, these processes go berserk. They use busy-waiting. It might
mean that there is a bug in our friends&#x2019; program, down the hall.” He smiles at
his own innocence in the matter. Clearly it is not his fault and it is nice to
be able to point the real ﬁnger of blame to those lesser mortals down the
hallway.
</p><!--l. 7185--><p class="indent" >  Dermot tears his eyes away from the T-shirt. What makes the system guys make
these ridiculous fashion statements? Jesus.
</p><!--l. 7188--><p class="indent" >  Technically, he too is a geek, but a moderate one by comparison.
</p><!--l. 7190--><p class="indent" >  “You know, I met Torvalds at that last conference in Amsterdam. He was saying
that . . .”

</p><!--l. 7193--><p class="indent" >  Dermot cuts him oﬀ, before he gets going. “You were saying about the
visitor.”
</p><!--l. 7196--><p class="indent" >  “A visitor? Ah yes,” He refocuses and reloads.
</p><!--l. 7198--><p class="indent" >  “Yes. An expert on the game – looks like you&#x2019;ll be working together, on your days
here. I hear that the Malaysians are quite good at this testing stuﬀ. You know that they
pay them next to nothing. Maybe we should brush up on our Portuguese – they all
speak it from colonial times. English too, I think.”
</p><!--l. 7204--><p class="indent" >  “What?” Dermot&#x2019;s mood dissolves into suspicion, peppered with tentative outrage.
Someone coming to work together with him? On the crime team&#x2019;s project work? He
has spent so long on this code that it feels like his own.
</p><!--l. 7209--><p class="indent" >  There are others who work on it, of course, and others still who test it, but he has
always felt as if he was its Oslo curator. This is his domain. Stupid really. Better
things to worry about. It will continue to be his if he just continues to do the best
job.
</p><!--l. 7214--><p class="indent" >  He changes the subject. Who cares who this girl is? “So what are you up to this
weekend.”
</p><!--l. 7217--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s my old man&#x2019;s birthday,” he says. “We&#x2019;re going out to the cottage. .
.”
</p><!--l. 7220--><p class="indent" >  “Hytte. . .hytte. . .” Dermot can&#x2019;t help himself from correcting him. Everyone
speaks such a funny version of the language these days. Something of a mixture
between American and their own pidgin Norwegian. Anyway, ‘cabin&#x2019; would be a
more accurate translation. Cottage sounds distinctly like an English thatched stone
house that hobbits live in.
</p><!--l. 7227--><p class="indent" >  “. . ..to go kayakking. Want to come?”
</p><!--l. 7229--><p class="indent" >  “No. No thanks. You know I&#x2019;m allergic to families. How old is your old man
now?”
</p><!--l. 7232--><p class="indent" >  “He&#x2019;ll be sixty seven. He&#x2019;s talking about starting over. I think he&#x2019;s bored. He&#x2019;d like
to start another family. You know – that thing they are advertising in the gulf for the
rich.” He laughs.
</p><!--l. 7236--><p class="indent" >  “Ugh. Isn&#x2019;t one more than enough?”
</p><!--l. 7238--><p class="indent" >  “Uh, well. I guess. Don&#x2019;t you have a family?”
</p><!--l. 7240--><p class="indent" >  “Sure. . .”
</p><!--l. 7242--><p class="indent" >  “Maybe you should try visiting them. Maybe it&#x2019;ll change your mind. Or
pick up some hot Berlinde and start one of your own.” Guﬀawing, from the
room.
</p><!--l. 7246--><p class="indent" >  Now he is sorry he asked. He pulls out of the game, having lost his concentration.
He hasn&#x2019;t found what he is looking for anyway. So much for Bishop&#x2019;s preaching.
</p><!--l. 7250--><p class="indent" >  “Fine. It sounds pretty weird to me.”
</p><!--l. 7252--><p class="indent" >  Families have never worked for him. They have always left him feeling like a ﬁfth,
square wheel. He has never quite found his niche. Dermot&#x2019;s mother was Irish, but he
half grew up here in Norway and has lived here for the past ten years, since ﬁnishing
his Master&#x2019;s degree in Cork. He ﬁnds all the family-bond blarney a source more of
distress than of comfort.

</p><!--l. 7259--><p class="indent" >  “What am I supposed to do now?” he says, to himself, to the world, to anyone who
is listening. What am I supposed to do now? About anything?
</p><!--l. 7263--><p class="indent" >  The others look at him, waiting for complaint in depth, but he would rather bury the
thought..
</p><!--l. 7266--><p class="indent" >  “Eat?”
</p><!--l. 7268--><p class="indent" >  He nods.
</p><!--l. 7270--><p class="indent" >  Even at the tender age of 31, Dermot has already lived what seems like three
separate lives. He has not changed appearance, or taken any genetic enhancements;
they have come about entirely naturally. That is a lot of lives to swallow for his
colleagues and friends here in Norway. Family-oriented society still survives to a
much greater extent here. People don&#x2019;t change. Status quo is everything.
Some adventurers take complete personality make-overs and relocate; he
simply changed his job and moved. None of his so-called lives has been worth
anything.
</p><!--l. 7280--><p class="indent" >  He joined a gaming company to see if he could recapture a sense of childhood fun
that he had never really dared to experience. All he can really remember about his
own, is being disinterested in other kids and in his family. He would hole
himself up and read. He bought electronics magazines because they were cool
and technical, but in all the years he never managed to make a single circuit
that worked. Software was his saviour. If you can&#x2019;t do the real thing, fake
it.
</p><!--l. 7289--><p class="indent" >  Eat.
</p><!--l. 7291--><p class="indent" >  His family was remote too. At the dinner table they never talked. It was a standing
rule that they had to eat together, but it was mainly a form of monitoring. It was not
for the joy of it, that much was certain. He saw other families, on TV, enjoying a meal
together, talking and laughing about their day. It all seemed disturbingly fake to
Dermot.
</p><!--l. 7298--><p class="indent" >  So, they are outsourcing to Malaysia these days.

<!--l. 7305--><p class="indent" >  Skim pages of info on the net. He has been putting this oﬀ, troubled by the
implications of the search and equally by his own weakness. Reminders are building
up in his in-box. Can&#x2019;t put it oﬀ any longer.
</p><!--l. 7309--><p class="indent" >  If any of what Bishop said is true then he ought to be able to conﬁrm most of it
from a reliable source. He turns to the muniﬁcent information highway for his
revelations.
</p><!--l. 7313--><p class="indent" >  Bishop said that people are using their mobiles to talk mainly to people they know
and like, avoiding people they don&#x2019;t know and that this is causing society to
break up—and he didn&#x2019;t just mean friends, he meant companies, businesses,

governments.
</p><!--l. 7318--><p class="indent" >  Dermot digs around, but it is hard to distinguish the conspiracy nut information
from serious discussion. Is it really true? Bishop recommended a few things, gave him
some pointers.
</p><!--l. 7322--><p class="indent" >  He ﬁnds an essay claiming that money is worth what people think it is worth. It
argues that if people lose conﬁdence in money, then society will really crash. You can
no longer buy each other&#x2019;s goods. You have to go back to trading favours for one
another to rebuild trust. That kind of ﬁts, but it is not about communication, is
it?
</p><!--l. 7328--><p class="indent" >  Dermot does not believe for a moment that society is breaking down, as Bishop
claims. It sounds ridiculous and hysterical. Yet there is a part of what he said
that resonates with intuition, with things he has seen of late. That cannot be
denied.
</p><!--l. 7333--><p class="indent" >  As a kid, he would trade picture cards and comic books as hard currency. An
original Sandman comic was worth way more than its Euro value to him and his
friends, but his mother regularly tried to make him dump them with the trash to clean
up his room.
</p><!--l. 7338--><p class="indent" >  If people are not using the same currencies, or have diﬀerent scales of value, then
they cannot interact. Society needs a convertible currency.
</p><!--l. 7341--><p class="indent" >  What else? Preferential attachment. People who are popular remain popular
because they attract attention. Okay. Some article about the ‘small world&#x2019;
phenomenon—the idea that we are all interconnected, by friends of friends, and that
there are no more than six degrees of separation between an Eskimo and the European
president? No. Six is an average number, not <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">the </span>number. Most people are further
away than that. But the article also says that the links that bind society are mainly
weak and few. Really?
</p><!--l. 7350--><p class="indent" >  So why? It goes on . . . most of us live in small cliques of a few close
friends. Like Bishop said. The reason we have the illusion of connectedness is
that there is always someone, in any clique, who knows someone in another
clique. It sounds like a precarious kind of model for the world, but the author
claims it is ‘remarkably robust and accurate&#x2019; as a depiction of society. So, if
these cliques share their own currency they are ﬁne amongst themselves, but
they need these inter-clique links to knit together. Dermot can easily see that
something could break down there. It is just like the communication pipes between
programming entities. Most of the errors occur when the pipes fail, not in the objects
themselves.
</p><!--l. 7362--><p class="indent" >  In fact, it reminds him of an old professor at College complaining that he could
never make his ﬁeld of research respectable because he could not persuade people of
the importance of publishing in an established, respected journal. They did not place
value on that; rather, they formed their own community, completely separate from
others, and said <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">screw you</span>.
</p><!--l. 7369--><p class="indent" >  They split oﬀ. Well, isn&#x2019;t that what Bishop was claiming? Perhaps it really is not
such a silly idea.

</p><!--l. 7372--><p class="indent" >  He saves some of the material, on his mobile, for later.
</p><!--l. 7374--><p class="indent" >  The most disturbing part of what Bishop said is the stuﬀ about propaganda: that
governments are manufacturing a campaign of manipulation to consolidate the power
of central government. He shudders at the thought. It sounds too much like what
happened in Russia after the breakup of the Soviet Union. Suddenly, large oil
companies and maﬁa operations ﬁnds themselves as large and inﬂuential as the
governments of the regions. They are governments in their own right, but
without a military—at least, a signiﬁcant one. Then there was Hamas in the
Palestinian territories, with a greater popular base than the cardboard leadership.
Governments cannot not always compete with these runaway groups. So call them
renegade and illegal, force them to take arms. Society breaks up. Maybe, but not
convinced. Where is the evidence from home? From here in Norway, for
instance?
</p><!--l. 7389--><p class="indent" >  He ﬁnds nothing speciﬁcally about Norway, but he ﬁnds a litany of references to
Televangelists, of the kind that Norway and the U.S. have in common. They and their
involvement in organized fraud, smuggling and tax evasion over the years—using
pious talk as a cover for pirate operations and bribery, right up to the level of
government. Some have been investigated by the F.B.I. and the crime team, and have
been found wanting.
</p><!--l. 7397--><p class="indent" >  One Tennessee Trinity-tycoon has been on the boards of drug companies and
international fashion-design houses, arms dealerships and diamond smuggling; using
money given to the church for international investments of stocks and proﬁteering
hardly seems concordant with the professed words of the church. It is not just a rare
or minor transgression, but a persistent and planned corruption and illegal
laundering.
</p><!--l. 7405--><p class="indent" >  And not just once. They come back and do it again, under diﬀerent church fronts.
They repeat their fraud. Criminals returning to the scene of a crime.
</p><!--l. 7409--><p class="indent" >  Evangelist preaching is nothing if not the most blatant form of mass media
propaganda. That much has always been clear to him. But it is preaching to the
converted, the desperate. It is more like mass hypnosis, or mass hysteria than
propaganda.
</p><!--l. 7414--><p class="indent" >  Isn&#x2019;t it?
</p><!--l. 7416--><p class="indent" >  All right.
</p><!--l. 7418--><p class="indent" >  Focus.
</p><!--l. 7420--><p class="indent" >  Backtrack a little. What am I looking for?
</p><!--l. 7422--><p class="indent" >  Propaganda. Coercion.
</p><!--l. 7424--><p class="indent" >  Let&#x2019;s see. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Propaganda is deﬁned as a concerted eﬀort to spread a doctrine.</span>
</p><!--l. 7427--><p class="indent" >  Okay. “Gee, Mr. nineteen-ﬁfties Incredible! Is that bolt radioactive? Radioactivity
is a powerful goodness, but we must keep it secure. Let&#x2019;s go! Not until we repair that
bridge, Frozone. Nothing is more important than keeping the American traﬃc
ﬂowing!”
</p><!--l. 7432--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">It is persuasion technique that is advantageous to the sender. It is intentional and it</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">is one-way communication.</span>

</p><!--l. 7436--><p class="indent" >  Not a dialogue.
</p><!--l. 7438--><p class="indent" >  Here is this ‘guy&#x2019; – this person – not a rag dummy that you throw on the bonﬁre,
like in Britain, but a man who let oﬀ some ﬁreworks of his own. His name was Walter
Lippmann. Considered the father of American journalism, it seems he was a writer of
propaganda leaﬂets for the Americans during the second world war. They used to ﬁre
leaﬂets in artillery shells into the enemy camps. They persuaded the enemy to give up,
and it worked sometimes!
</p><!--l. 7446--><p class="indent" >  That ﬁgures, Dermot thinks. I mean, how many of us are just doing something
for someone else, without questioning it, without any idea of why? Do we
even care? Why should we? We are just doing what we&#x2019;re supposed to. And
who decides what “supposed to” means? That is just our ‘life&#x2019; and we are
supposed to accept it. And why not? What the fuck else would we do? There is
no meaning to life anyway. At least, unless you make one of your own. .
.
</p><!--l. 7454--><p class="indent" >  Anyway, apparently, Lippmann eventually saw how easily people were taken in by
propaganda and became so disillusioned with the general public&#x2019;s lack of critical
reasoning, that he wrote a book, <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">The Phantom Public</span>, in which he said that the public
had essentially no role to play in the governance of society, in government, because
they were just too pig ignorant. Keep people stupid and they will follow, like a herd of
sheep.
</p><!--l. 7462--><p class="indent" >  The more the public trusts in the spoon-fed convenience of the media, the less they
bother to ﬁnd out for themselves, and the less reason they have to criticize
or question the information they are fed. It ends in a downward spiral of
complacency.
</p><!--l. 7467--><p class="indent" >  Well, that pretty much describes the West, he thinks. Hell, if it weren&#x2019;t for the BBC,
we might as well give our souls away on a platter, right now.
</p><!--l. 7471--><p class="indent" >  Here&#x2019;s something. Reference to the Institute for Propaganda Analysis,
1937.
</p><!--l. 7474--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Jesus, such a thing exists? </span>Seems real. . .
</p><!--l. 7476--><p class="indent" >  It claims to have identiﬁed seven techniques for coercion. The Sun Tzu of
deception. A kind of propaganda karate.
</p><!--l. 7480--><p class="indent" >  He notes them down. Here we go.
</p><!--l. 7482--><p class="indent" >  1. Name calling to inﬂuence perception. (The <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">evil terrorists</span>, this <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">great </span>country of
ours. . .)
</p><!--l. 7485--><p class="indent" >  Sticks and stones might break my bones, but whips and chains excite me!
</p><!--l. 7487--><p class="indent" >  2. The selective use (and suppression) of facts to support a point of view. (It was in
the papers that some unknown object crashed, the night the alien ship landed. The
object was actually a weather balloon, but you don&#x2019;t need to know that. .
.)
</p><!--l. 7491--><p class="indent" >  3. Implying the existence of a bandwagon of popular opinion for your doctrine.
(Join the increasing number to have plastic surgery now! 8 out of 10 dogs said their
cats preferred it!)
</p><!--l. 7495--><p class="indent" >  4. Using respected ﬁgures to support the cause. (Abraham Lincoln swore by it!

Luke Skywalker used it against Darth Vader!)
</p><!--l. 7499--><p class="indent" >  5. Associating the idea with the common folk. (Computers for dummies, not those
smart geek assholes!)
</p><!--l. 7501--><p class="indent" >  6. Then there is associative transfer—using a symbol of something good to
appeal to patriotism or other emotions, something like the national ﬂag, or
associating the cause with democracy. (As you can see, I am wearing this French
beret and stripy shirt, so now you know our food is of the highest culinary
standard!)
</p><!--l. 7507--><p class="indent" >  7. That brings us to the technique of ‘glittering generality&#x2019;, or using words like
freedom or democracy that push peoples moral guilt buttons: a slogan so attractive
that its audience cannot fail to be taken in. (If you love democracy and freedom, you
have to let us invade their country!)
</p><!--l. 7514--><p class="indent" >  This is actually fun, Dermot thinks, though it seems to him that this is nothing more
than modern marketing techniques.. It begins to make sense to him why a government
would be interested in the game: for the same reason that advertisers are. . . and one
more thing. Aspects of modern warfare look like a video game. No denying
that. If your message is warfare, legitimizing military incursions and the
like, then the game&#x2019;s battle sims are a good starting place. Associate your
political objectives with this fun game and see the world reaching top score in
months!
</p><!--l. 7524--><p class="indent" >  Dermot goes to Petter to hear what he thinks. Naturally, this is no surprise to
him.
</p><!--l. 7527--><p class="indent" >  “Have you seen the reference in the game development manual itself?” he asks. It
quotes President George W. Bush from a West-point speech at the start of the
century:
</p><!--l. 7531--><p class="indent" >  “<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">We have a great opportunity to extend a just peace, by replacing poverty,</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">repression, and resentment around the world with hope of a better day. . . The 20th</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">century ended with a single surviving model of human progress, based on</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">non-negotiable demands of human dignity, the rule of law, limits on the power</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">of state, respect for women and free private property and free speech and</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">equal justice and religious tolerance. American cannot impose this vision. .</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">.</span>”
</p><!--l. 7539--><p class="indent" >  Great language, reminiscent of Lincoln himself, and all the right push-buttons:
freedom, women&#x2019;s rights, religious tolerance. . . Then, he invaded Iraq and cast a
nation into darkness, poverty and violence, exchanging rule by fear, grotesque
individual torture of Iraqis, for mass deaths in the foreshadow of a democratic
dream.
</p><!--l. 7547--><p class="indent" >  Why doesn&#x2019;t the media uncover these un-truths, these exaggerations and
deceptions? Too much eﬀort? Too much risk. People go quiet, instead. They return to
their private channels and talk amongst themselves. To their splinter groups. In the
safety of their cocoon. In their own virtual reality.
</p><!--l. 7553--><p class="indent" >  It is only the blanket, insipid nonsense that is suitable for mass consumption on the
news channels.

</p><!--l. 7556--><p class="indent" >  Rational inﬂuence is calculated using game theory, Petter says. Propaganda is about
forcing irrational choices on others.
</p><!--l. 7559--><p class="indent" >  Of course people would turn inward.

</p><!--l. 7594--><p class="indent" >  Dermot can no longer claim to understand, in detail, the reason for his clandestine
personal life, for his secretiveness. He knows only that he wants no one to know
about what he does or doesn&#x2019;t do in his private time. It has something to
do with his parents and their unnatural attitude towards human relations;
something to do with the humiliation of being paraded as an oddball in front of his
mother&#x2019;s women&#x2019;s group as a child; something about his father&#x2019;s pretending that
aﬀection and desire were non-existent concepts. Watching television was deadly
embarrassment: if someone kissed or there was a hint of sex, it would be switched oﬀ
immediately.
</p><!--l. 7605--><p class="indent" >  He has a recollection, at the age of three years; he is sitting in a neighbour&#x2019;s
house; she is his baby sitter. They sit in a sunken settee, next to a droning

wore for household chores, but he remembers little else about her. Only the
incident.
</p><!--l. 7611--><p class="indent" >  She has made them something to drink—a beaker of fruit juice. She is settled
with her cup of tea, all cosy, reading a newspaper and he has climbed up
next to her with his beaker of juice. She stretches out an aﬀectionate arm to
him and they huddle together reading the small ads. Dermot cannot read at

this age, but he sees an advertisement for a shower, with a line drawing of a
nude woman standing in a shower cabinet. Her back is turned, and only the
merest hint of her behind is visible. He had not seen anything like this before.
He reacts as a child would. As a child should. He points out of fascination.

purity of logic and imperative thought will cleanse his mind of this unpleasant
skullduggery.
</p><!--l. 7653--><p class="indent" >  It is dark now. It is almost eight in the evening. He gets on a tram at Biermanns gate
and endures its ponderous ride down to the city centre.
</p><!--l. 7657--><p class="indent" >  As he reaches Schous Plass, Nazis invade the tram. Skin headed hulks, in a noisy
gang. Dermot is immediately uncomfortable. If he could get oﬀ the tram
now, he would. But they have ﬁlled up the car so that no one can get past
them.
</p><!--l. 7662--><p class="indent" >  They have good looking girls with them. How the hell do they do that? They are
slick and elegant. What are they doing together with these denim clad, skin head
jerks?
</p><!--l. 7666--><p class="indent" >  They are carrying beer glasses that they took with them from one of the pubs along
Grünerløkka. That is pretty illegal. They throw themselves around for show. They are
telling absurd jokes about Jews too loudly, making a statement to the unwilling public
on the tram. Everyone is looking pretty uncomfortable, but they are trapped in this
metal box.
</p><!--l. 7673--><p class="indent" >  Dermot realizes that there is a football match on. They are wearing the colours of

some Norwegian football tribe. Fucking savages. Why the hell isn&#x2019;t football banned
these days? It turns grown men into little more than a gang of beer guzzling
chimpanzees.
</p><!--l. 7678--><p class="indent" >  Dermot takes out his mobile and starts keying. Little do these fuckers know that he
is one of the principal coders of the police commando network. From his mobile, he
can key into the system to alert the forces around town to a potential altercation. He
doesn&#x2019;t know it for sure, but it is not hard to guess that this group will be trouble. The
football scarves are just a cover.
</p><!--l. 7685--><p class="indent" >  He hates them. They are not people. They are not even ﬁt to be characters in the
VR. Why do they have to be here? Mobile communications, alone, can not be
responsible for this. No matter what Bishop says.
</p><!--l. 7690--><p class="indent" >  As the tram swings into Stortorvet next to the department store, he sees the
policemen and women standing watch. Some of them were here already, in such a
public centre. Others arrive quietly by van nearby. There are many people standing
around the tram stop, walking on their way for a night out, or whatever it is that
people with lives do.
</p><!--l. 7697--><p class="indent" >  Suddenly something startles the skin-heads. One of the shouts, “Fuck! Did you see
that fucking queer?” Dermot cannot see anyone out of the ordinary outside on the
street, but the skin-heads are excited now. They causally discard their women,
attendant to the promise of violence. “There he is!” As the tram halts and the doors
open, the one who called out throws his beer glass to the ground, smashing it and
splashing beer over the tram ﬂoor. He storms out, with hatred in his glare, straight
towards some random individual in the crowd. Dermot cannot see anything
special about this man. He must be forty or ﬁfty, with a thick beard. He doesn&#x2019;t
look very gay, but the Nazi walks up to him and simply punches him without
warning.
</p><!--l. 7709--><p class="indent" >  His friends storm out of the tram, now in full gear for a ﬁght. The man they have
beaten is incredulous. He staggers backwards and falls away from the thug who hit
him, who looks around him for approval from his peers before laying in for the kill.
This gives the older man a pause to protect himself.
</p><!--l. 7715--><p class="indent" >  But the police are standing right next to the scene and have heard the altercation.
The stupid Nazis haven&#x2019;t even seen them. Dermot&#x2019;s heart is racing and his
whole body is tense, as he watches the police rush to the scene. This is a lucky
break for the man, and for the rest of the town. With any luck, the police will
take these jerks oﬀ the streets tonight. Maybe even treat them for violent
behaviour.
</p><!--l. 7722--><p class="indent" >  Dermot feels a relief, but also a discomfort at seeing his safety bubble so nearly
penetrated by such an ugly sight. Jesus, he almost cannot believe that some people
expose themselves to this kind of barbarism willingly by attending these football
matches. What on Earth are they thinking?
</p><!--l. 7729--><p class="indent" >  He is reminded of something Bishop said to him. Society works because,
collectively, it can wield disproportionate force against even the smallest
transgressions of its doctrine. That is what keeps the people in line. It is the idea

behind zero-tolerance policing. If the force is undermined, people lose their consensus
of belief in the doctrine, by slowly testing the boundaries of acceptable behaviour.
Random crime, opportunistic pathogen. Eventually the provocateurs&#x2019; self-interest
overpowers their instinct to conform – and they become anti-social. Now he has seen
it with his own eyes.
</p><!--l. 7739--><p class="indent" >  He snaps shut the cover on his mobile just as someone sits down beside him. It is
the girl whom he met just the other day.
</p><!--l. 7742--><p class="indent" >  “Hei”, she says.
</p><!--l. 7744--><p class="indent" >  “Hello”, he replies with a genuine smile. “Did you see that?”
</p><!--l. 7746--><p class="indent" >  She nods. She does not look scared or shocked, or even glad that it is over. She is
beautiful, he thinks. The tram rumbles on to the next stop.
</p><!--l. 7750--><p class="indent" >  “Lucky I was here,” he tells her, waving his mobile. “Not everyone works for the
enforcement net.”
</p><!--l. 7753--><p class="indent" >  She seems impressed.
</p><!--l. 7755--><p class="indent" >  “So I have been having trouble with my computer, at home. Maybe you could help
me with it?”
</p><!--l. 7758--><p class="indent" >  Heart misses a beat. He nods. “Sure, why not.” He touches his wristwatch and
beams her his number by infrared.
</p><!--l. 7761--><p class="indent" >  “You already gave me a card.” Then she gets up and walks towards the
exit, without saying good-bye, or even looking his way. Just a matter of fact
transaction of information. Then she gets oﬀ the tram and walks oﬀ into the
night.

hooligans.
</p><!--l. 7820--><p class="indent" >  Vibe places the broken VeiVek at the mouth of the valley, before her descent down
to the cabin, making a quick test to see if she can connect to the other. It seems to
work for now. So assuming that the other does not get shot up on its way
back. she might be able to sew together a network by the time she gets down
the hill. She starts a mapping program to get the locations of as many of
the little robots as she can. Cloud is lifting, so this one should be charging
nicely.
</p><!--l. 7828--><p class="indent" >  The program should do its work while she is burning her thighs on the descent,
back down the valley. Imagine the worst case scenario; if these assholes have
destroyed many of the robots, then this could be all she has left for her thesis. The
thought is not very heart-warming.
</p><!--l. 7833--><p class="indent" >  When she arrives back at the cabin, Mr. Muﬃns is waiting on the bench outside the

</p><!--l. 7836--><p class="indent" >  “Been out for a walk?”

</p><!--l. 7840--><p class="indent" >  “Thought we we&#x2019;re supposed to stay put. You came in yesterday though,
didn&#x2019;t you?” There is a trace of disapproval in those eyes, but he hides it
well.

<!--l. 7864--><p class="indent" >  Vibe opens a window to get some fresh air. She can smell rain. The room opens to
the sound of the rushing brook and a cold breeze. She will need this aural sense of
space and cooling wind to counter the claustrophobia of the little room when she
enters the game. You cannot balance the illusion of reality without some tactile
stimulus.
</p><!--l. 7870--><p class="indent" >  She takes out her mobile&#x2019;s travel kit and digs in her backpack for the glasses. It has
been a while now since she was in the VR, but she and Bea have arranged to meet.
She needs the comfort of companionship. She feels abandoned. Time for a little
fun.
</p><!--l. 7875--><p class="indent" >  The batteries are well charged from the solar fabric and boot dynamos. She can be
in there for a couple of hours if she needs to, this close to an antenna. There&#x2019;s no
electricity here in the rooms.
</p><!--l. 7879--><p class="indent" >  She dons the jewellery and gloves of oﬃce and ties the components in to her
home-station for integrated capture and feedback. Vibe leaves her mobile on receive
mode, in case the French team tries to call, and dives in. Kill the light and enter
VR.
</p><!--l. 7884--><p class="indent" >  Appearance can be almost anything one desires in the game; ﬂap your whims and
lie away. There are some restrictions. She could not appear as a table or as an
inanimate object without risking attention. Those things are forbidden by the software
and would run the risk of triggering alarms and errors that would bring her into the
spotlight of a monitor. It is not even supposed to be possible, but like most software
the game is not very well written, and she could do it if she pleased. She knows how.
It is common knowledge.
</p><!--l. 7893--><p class="indent" >  With only her travel glasses to paint her landscape it takes Vibe a while to adjust to
her new surroundings, to integrate: the wind from outdoors and the distant rush of
water of the valley intrude and confuse, but they are necessary as she goes deeper.
The game is huge, but she and Bea have found a serendipitous secret in this
world.
</p><!--l. 7899--><p class="indent" >  She enters the VR in downtown Plovdiv to meet Bea.
</p><!--l. 7901--><p class="indent" >  It was their private joke to meet here and then migrate somewhere else afterwards.
She remembers Plovdiv from a summer holiday some years ago. The visit was mainly
characterized by rushing from toilet to toilet to relieve her explosive bowels of what
could have been a build-up from a pressurized water reactor. Here in the VR such
Earthly inconveniences scarcely intrude from the real world. Then it became more
than a joke.
</p><!--l. 7909--><p class="indent" >  She has learned a thing or two about the game here in Plovdiv. The game is not
well built here. I mean, who wants to come to this backwater by choice? No
one except the Bulgarian hacker communities, and they were just so nice
in leaving shoddy back-doors open when she and Bea ﬁrst started coming
here. So it was possible for them to get access to the game at a level that
most players would not even know about. Vibe was just the person to take

advantage.
</p><!--l. 7918--><p class="indent" >  She materializes quite quickly here. Although she is in a sim of the real world, there
is no mandatory materialization warning. This part of town is quiet and the details are
sparse, so it does not get much attention from the system. No one comes here
for virtual tourism. Duh. Fans of concrete and old communist iconography
perhaps.
</p><!--l. 7924--><p class="indent" >  She ﬁnds herself in a familiar, paved shopping street, adjacent to a main road and
fairly empty of people. In such a remote location as Plovdiv, many of the
ﬁgures she sees are sims—padding to provide a realistic background. Long
legged skinny beauties in short skirts are scattered around, looking into the
clothes shops. One of them could be Bea, but Vibe knows that is not her
style.
</p><!--l. 7931--><p class="indent" >  Usually, they begin their meetings with a friendly game of hide and seek, to see
who can fool the other for the longest time, though this game has been wearing a little
thin of late. Bea has lately been seeing someone she met on a one-nighter, and Vibe
has been tied up with work, trying to ﬁgure out what is going on with the VeiVeks.
They have not done this for a while.
</p><!--l. 7938--><p class="indent" >  The little paved street is near to a crossroads of small shopping streets. People are
sitting outside their shops on shiny plastic chairs, wallowing in the heat. Of course,
there is no heat here really in VR, but the visual illusion is quite good, confusing her
body in the valley chill.
</p><!--l. 7944--><p class="indent" >  Vibe is about to walk into a small shop and buy something for show when a stray
dog jumps up and paws her. “Gotcha, girl,” says Bea.
</p><!--l. 7947--><p class="indent" >  Vibe is quick oﬀ the mark and morphs into a speciﬁc tree for Bea, and only for a
moment. “Don&#x2019;t disrespect your Elders, dog,” she laughs.
</p><!--l. 7951--><p class="indent" >  The dog paws her and lifts its hind leg. “Old joke, but we love the dress!”
</p><!--l. 7954--><p class="indent" >  This all looks rather silly and out of place for their surroundings, but that is what
one might expect from a couple of stupid girls playing. And hell, that&#x2019;s as good a
cover as any.
</p><!--l. 7958--><p class="indent" >  Bea barks for good measure and says, “Come on!”
</p><!--l. 7960--><p class="indent" >  As dogs, they both lope oﬀ through the streets, through the small town centre and
out past the concrete monstrosities of the former Soviet era. No one will care about a
couple of stray dogs in Plovdiv. They take oﬀ in search of a hidden menu
panel: their springboard to mischief. The panel moves around from time to
time, so they need to locate it ﬁrst. They have done this a dozen times in the
past.
</p><!--l. 7967--><p class="indent" >  “Let&#x2019;s try the station.”
</p><!--l. 7969--><p class="indent" >  The old train station is practically in ruins, in reality, but it has been the oﬃcial
hiding place of all kinds of back-doors in the game for some time. They discovered it
by accident on one of their ﬁrst trips.
</p><!--l. 7974--><p class="indent" >  “How&#x2019;s things up in Valhalla?” Bea asks, as they trot through the town.
</p><!--l. 7976--><p class="indent" >  Vibe huﬀs. “Don&#x2019;t ask. They have totally fucked oﬀ and left me here. There is no
one here. And – wait for it – the mountains are oﬃcially oﬀ limits because of some

stupid gang thing going on. I had to slip past this police bitch to get up here and now
they are probably going to be on my back.”
</p><!--l. 7981--><p class="indent" >  “Come home,” she suggests. “Nothing to do up there.”
</p><!--l. 7983--><p class="indent" >  “Can&#x2019;t. I have to sort this out somehow. Otherwise I&#x2019;m toast. My project depends
on this.”
</p><!--l. 7986--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah. This is your dream project. Sorry girl.”
</p><!--l. 7988--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah.”
</p><!--l. 7990--><p class="indent" >  They scamper down a dilapidated stair case to one of the train platforms and drop
down onto what used to be the railway track. It is overgrown with grasses now, but
there is a hint that there was once a train in the relief of the landscape. They walk
along the platform.
</p><!--l. 7995--><p class="indent" >  “So I met this guy,” Bea gossips. “I told you right? Quite cute but way too
interested. He came and just asked me if I would be interested in a date. He
actually said stuﬀ like there is something special about me. It was really
creepy.”
</p><!--l. 8000--><p class="indent" >  “Well, we all know what&#x2019;s special about you, girl,” Vibe quips, still a little
moody.
</p><!--l. 8003--><p class="indent" >  “Ta dahhhh.”
</p><!--l. 8005--><p class="indent" >  “A <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">date</span>?”
</p><!--l. 8007--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah. Retro. And so I thought: Loser.”
</p><!--l. 8009--><p class="indent" >  “As you would. As you should.”
</p><!--l. 8011--><p class="indent" >  “But then it turns out that he is like this actor who has been in a couple of movies
that I have never seen. And he suddenly starts talking to this guy who apparently is his
bodyguard. Bodyguard! And so he rose in my estimation. And the bodyguard was
pretty hot too.”
</p><!--l. 8016--><p class="indent" >  “Ew—bad call.”
</p><!--l. 8018--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah, but not to worry. I regretted my decision and decided to allow him a second
chance. Threw a body-scan and waited for him to come back.”
</p><!--l. 8022--><p class="indent" >  “Hey! You are so cool, feline.”
</p><!--l. 8024--><p class="indent" >  “Reversed course. Now he&#x2019;s on the payroll. Met Mr. Finger yet?”
</p><!--l. 8026--><p class="indent" >  Vibe cringes. “Please! Don&#x2019;t call him that! No I haven&#x2019;t. No one is here. I mean no
one. And they don&#x2019;t even answer my messages.”
</p><!--l. 8029--><p class="indent" >  “Isn&#x2019;t that a bit weird?”
</p><!--l. 8031--><p class="indent" >  “A bit? It is seriously weird. You don&#x2019;t just start working with someone and the
disappear oﬀ the face of the planet.”
</p><!--l. 8034--><p class="indent" >  “Creepy.”
</p><!--l. 8036--><p class="indent" >  “Trouble is, they seem to have taken all my work with them.”
</p><!--l. 8038--><p class="indent" >  “Hey, over here, this way. So what are you going to do?”
</p><!--l. 8040--><p class="indent" >  “Good question. I need to talk to my advisor, but he&#x2019;s never available.”
</p><!--l. 8042--><p class="indent" >  “For you? I thought no one ever said no to Sara Stensrud.”
</p><!--l. 8044--><p class="indent" >  “Dammit you&#x2019;re right. Why should I take no for an answer? I should start a full
scale assault. Hack my way in! Program these little robots to invade his oﬃce! Track
him down and subdue him!”

</p><!--l. 8048--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s the spirit. But that won&#x2019;t help you ﬁnd Mr. Finger.”
</p><!--l. 8050--><p class="indent" >  “To be honest, I don&#x2019;t really feel like talking about it.”
</p><!--l. 8052--><p class="indent" >  “Really?”
</p><!--l. 8054--><p class="indent" >  “Really. I am pretty exhausted. Haven&#x2019;t walked this far for ages. My buttress has
gotten used to propping up a terminal, not walking up a mountain.”
</p><!--l. 8058--><p class="indent" >  Vibe stops for a moment, while she thinks. Bea trots around and comes back.
“What&#x2019;s up?”
</p><!--l. 8061--><p class="indent" >  “Wait a second.”
</p><!--l. 8063--><p class="indent" >  “What is it?”
</p><!--l. 8065--><p class="indent" >  ”I have to try once more.”.
</p><!--l. 8067--><p class="indent" >  Bea waits. “Okay.”
</p><!--l. 8069--><p class="indent" >  She wiggles her thumb inside its glove. “Game command, options.”
</p><!--l. 8071--><p class="indent" >  A scroll of text unrolls in front of her. She selects New Contact, Private Channel
and a translucent box, like a telephone booth, comes down over her, cutting out the
sound from the VR. It is quiet now, except for the sound of the stream from the world
outside her room. She selects as the recipient Jonas Lindgren and waits for a
connection. Connecting. . .
</p><!--l. 8078--><p class="indent" >  The network of mountain cabin relays never sleeps, even here in the mountains,
powered by its solar batteries. The signal strength is good. But it takes longer than
it should. The ring-tone purrs away for what seems like a eternity. Just as
she is about to give up: “Recipient is marked busy. Would you like to be
transferred?”
</p><!--l. 8084--><p class="indent" >  Vibe screams inside herself. “Yes!” Damn you.
</p><!--l. 8086--><p class="indent" >  Instantly the view changes to an image of a receptionist. “Hello, Ms. Stensrud, how
may I help you?”
</p><!--l. 8089--><p class="indent" >  “Uh hello. I have been trying to reach Jonas Lindgren for most of today and
yesterday. Can you tell me why he is not available?”
</p><!--l. 8092--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m sorry, Mr. Lindgren is listed as being busy today. You should be able to see a
link to his message service, if you wish to leave a message?”
</p><!--l. 8095--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, thanks. I know that, but I really need to speak to him.”
</p><!--l. 8097--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m afraid we haven&#x2019;t been able to reach him all day. Best to try again
later.”
</p><!--l. 8100--><p class="indent" >  “Right.”
</p><!--l. 8102--><p class="indent" >  She stabs the exit control moodily and lets out a growl. Normally, her dog head
would have morphed to display this emotion, but they do not want to attract
attention in this area. Realism is best when wandering around in the real-world
sims.
</p><!--l. 8107--><p class="indent" >  Bea has moved oﬀ while she was talking. Vibe catches her up.
</p><!--l. 8109--><p class="indent" >  “So I found the door panel,” she says.
</p><!--l. 8111--><p class="indent" >  “Cool. So what do you want to do?”
</p><!--l. 8113--><p class="indent" >  “Fuck this. Let&#x2019;s go and play with the soldiers? Pwease? Can we? Can
we?”

<!--l. 8122--><p class="indent" >  Sailing high over the Earth, navigating the land and seas as if with a superimposed
map of the ancient Mariners, the girls choose their destination and soar back through
the satellite captured details, down to VTerra ﬁrma. Down towards the desert. X marks
the spot.
</p><!--l. 8127--><p class="indent" >  The illusion of ﬂight is dizzying, but they know it is artiﬁcial. They could choose to
switch it oﬀ, but this is part of the fun. Once the mind has absorbed the imagery
and the illusion, Vibe ﬁnds it hard to imagine that she is still Earth-bound,
until the pins and needles settle into her legs. It is like getting lost in a good
book, but more so. You are really talking, really moving. More of the brain is
engaged.
</p><!--l. 8135--><p class="indent" >  The game is a multi-dimensional House-that-Jack-built, she has often thought, in
which Jack might spring out of his box and surprise you at any moment. On the ﬁrst
level, there is a satellite and indoor-cam mapped facsimile of the planet. The outdoor
areas of this level are always close to what the real world looks like. They are for
those who simply want to explore the world from the privacy of their own homes, for
the disabled and for the poor who cannot travel. After all, travel is now for the rich
or the bold. Most people in the Western world do not want to travel from
the safety of their homes and most in the developing world cannot aﬀord
to.
</p><!--l. 8146--><p class="indent" >  The second level is a world map with modiﬁed scenery, oﬀering a variety of
smaller game scenarios, historical depictions and futuristic scenarios. These are
as much chatrooms as anything else. The capabilities are quite limited for
exploring your fantasies. The main selling point of these is the fact that, no matter
who or where you are, you can talk to other players in your own language.
That is fairly cool. The only minus is all of the half-hidden advertising: the
Christian cajoling and the Jewish chutzpah that is supposed to bring you back to
God.
</p><!--l. 8156--><p class="indent" >  They are heading for Baghdad, to the centre of the war-games. It has become their
favourite mischief. Messing with the Man.
</p><!--l. 8159--><p class="indent" >  Formless observers, privileged with powers beyond their status, they move quickly
in ghost mode over Fellujah and over the desert past Baghdad to the site of the old
Islamic House of Wisdom. There is a ﬁtting tribute to this historical site in the history
level. It is the site to which all of modern technology owes its birth. This was where
the old scholars would gather and write, on their imported Chinese paper, of
mathematics and of medicine. Perhaps they wrote love letters to the Mongol
overlord who eventually destroyed them. And yet no one much goes there. They
are all too busy in the war-game sims. So Vibe and Bea come here too, to

play.
</p><!--l. 8170--><p class="indent" >  The decorations in VR are eclectic. A lot of attention has been given to details here,
she thinks. This is a popular part of the game, especially amongst young
American males and young anti-American males. This is where they come to
play their war games—one of the few fully planned and constructed parts of
the game, where a combination of a fantasy scenario and virtual tourism
by camera are skillfully interwoven for maximum realism. In that respect,
it is more popular than the North Korea war-gaming sim, which is more a
way of planning possible scenarios for invasion. The country is still a black
hole.
</p><!--l. 8181--><p class="indent" >  It is a work of multiple artists, not a singular vision. It has the feel of a biology of
competing messages. It is an open endeavour; only the basic rules of this world are
proprietary and secret.
</p><!--l. 8185--><p class="indent" >  For an essentially Islamic part of the world, there is a lot of Western symbolism
going on though. She and Bea like to come here and make fun of it all. Why is it that
the Western players have to stop at Christian churches to recharge themselves when
they lose? Why do messages from command come by Angel? Why are all the enemy
ﬁgures in the game so ugly and have non-American accents? And if they are all so
goddamned pious, why do they spend half their time in VR brothels with hired
harems?
</p><!--l. 8194--><p class="indent" >  She cannot understand why anyone would even pay to join the real ﬁghting in the
region. Some of these war rooms are actually connected by camera to real tanks and
battlements in the real Middle East. They actually sponsor the hostilities by
paying to drive some war machinery by remote. What makes someone want
to revel in someone else&#x2019;s tragedy, as if it were just some more prime-time
entertainment?
</p><!--l. 8201--><p class="indent" >  The Christian imagery has probably been paid for in full by some rich
son-of-a-bitch. It is so blatant, so insulting. Fortunately, in the supervisor levels, where
she and Bea have learned how to exist, the programmers apparently have a sense of
humour and have arranged some ﬁlters for themselves that make the Christian
mythology more like kitschy humour than anything else. She can imagine that only
America&#x2019;s Bible Belt and Norway&#x2019;s own Christian South actually take any of this
seriously anyway.
</p><!--l. 8210--><p class="indent" >  Vibe has always coveted matters of the human spirit, of art and of beauty, but she
needs no supernatural explanation for these things, no holy spirit. There is no
contradiction, in her mind, between those irrational human values and the cold
procedures and uncertainties of science. Science only adds to the appreciation.
Religion is just trying to suppress questions. That is not acceptable. It is not
spirituality, she thinks, it&#x2019;s politics. Asking the questions is what moves our spirits
forward.
</p><!--l. 8219--><p class="indent" >  Teenage kids drive their armoured vehicles amongst the actual tanks and patrols of
the Gulf deserts. She sees how they are authorized to direct weapons on the
actual artillery to help out with the allied forces&#x2019;. People&#x2019;s lives hang in the

balance of this video game. It seems like a basic moral duty to put a spanner
in the works, if she can, but it could be dangerous for someone to interfere
here.
</p><!--l. 8226--><p class="indent" >  Wait.
</p><!--l. 8228--><p class="indent" >  Something has caught her eye.
</p><!--l. 8230--><p class="indent" >  When they ﬁrst arrived here, there were just two sides to this battle. The sides are
visible in her supervisor-mode visual ﬁeld as a colour coding. Each side has its own
private com channel. When she ﬁrst started coming here, there were only two. Now
there are ﬁve.
</p><!--l. 8236--><p class="indent" >  Five sides? Five independent groups in one conﬂict? Whose side are they on? Every
group for itself, against all the others? They seem to be deploying through the same
landscape in similar patterns, as if they are all trying to cover the battleﬁeld as
well as possible. She has seen the pattern before: with the VeiVeks. It is the
same kind of strategy they have started to use since they lost their central
control.
</p><!--l. 8244--><p class="indent" >  “Wait a minute, have to make a note for later.”
</p><!--l. 8246--><p class="indent" >  She and Bea watch other players for a little while. See some action. Be depressed
about human nature. PhoxHollywood branches reach outwards in all directions from
here: to Saudi Arabia, to Palestine and Israel. But this is not the real fun. The real fun
(the real phun) is in taking the players for a ride they were not expecting. .
.
</p><!--l. 8252--><p class="indent" >  Down to the red lights of the human playground, where Arabs and Western
insurgents are all friends again. They morph into beautiful African women, with slight
but colourful garbs, in preparation for their handiwork around the Persian
gulf.
</p><!--l. 8257--><p class="indent" >  “What do you think?”
</p><!--l. 8259--><p class="indent" >  “Oh my, that is seriously sexy!”
</p><!--l. 8261--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t you think it makes me look fat?”
</p><!--l. 8263--><p class="indent" >  “You? You&#x2019;re safe.”
</p><!--l. 8265--><p class="indent" >  She looks around the wonderful decorations of the hallways of the baths. The
scenery is exquisite, detailed and presumably authentic.
</p><!--l. 8268--><p class="indent" >  Now, play like sims. See what you can get these boys to cough up to, when they
think they&#x2019;re in bed with a simulation!
</p><!--l. 8271--><p class="indent" >  “Hey boys, I know we should have called, but we just wanted to drop in.”
</p><!--l. 8273--><p class="indent" >  “Very smooth.”
</p><!--l. 8275--><p class="indent" >  “Hey what about that girl over there?”
</p><!--l. 8277--><p class="indent" >  “Ugh, slutty chick deluxe. Let&#x2019;s move in on her turf. Heehee.”

It has been dark for some time when Vibe comes out. She falls quickly into a deep
cleansing sleep.
</p><!--l. 8293--><p class="indent" >  She awakens in the early hours of the next morning, feeling stiﬀ but not paralysed.
She ﬁnds her note-to-self; she tries again to reach Jonas.
</p><!--l. 8297--><p class="indent" >  Anxiety about the PhD project has grown from calm concern to nervous
anticipation. Visions of her thesis whirling down the spout, in a maelstrom of
footballers&#x2019; paint, have begun to intrude on her assuredness. Then she thinks of Peter
Green. Is it really worth the risk of getting shot up with paint-balls, just to see this
person, who probably has no idea who she is, or why he is important to her
can&#x2019;t-get-over-it teenage fantasy?
</p><!--l. 8305--><p class="indent" >  She lies for a while, in the warmth of her quilt, gathering strength and resolve then
rises, curiously balanced, and back in control. Time for breakfast. She should
probably check in with mountain rescue.
</p><!--l. 8309--><p class="indent" >  Ugh. :-(
</p><!--l. 8311--><p class="indent" >  Maybe. The longer she waits, the harder it gets.
</p><!--l. 8313--><p class="indent" >  She pulls on some loosely ﬁtting jogging pants and some lightweight shoes
and heads across the yard to the main cabin, where breakfast is served. It is
markedly colder today. The sky is grey and damp. It will probably snow
later.
</p><!--l. 8318--><p class="indent" >  The weather seems to be attached to a yo-yo. Yin-yang. Flip-ﬂop.
</p><!--l. 8320--><p class="indent" >  Sara smiles cheekily to the desk help, swishing her long hair aside, as she walks
past and follows the cabin around from the reception to the lounge to the dining room,
where the predictable mountain breakfast buﬀet is waiting.
</p><!--l. 8325--><p class="indent" >  The pale wooden room is almost empty. Let&#x2019;s face it, most people are at home in
their warm lives at this time of year. From now on, the mountains will become rather
inhospitable. Her little VeiVeks have only two more weeks of service before they
would have been retired for this season.
</p><!--l. 8331--><p class="indent" >  There is a couple sitting together at the end of the room, and what looks like a
family group, standing around the buﬀet, with their little slices of grease-proof paper,
making their lunch packs. It is the lunch-pack ritual. Genetically programmed into
every Norwegian. But she has had jean therapy. When will they learn about
Tupperware?
</p><!--l. 8337--><p class="indent" >  They are ﬂagging for everyone to see: I am born of the mountain. I am one with
tradition and nature. I shall pack my lunch into this white grease-proof paper, as if it
were an albino Christmas gift, ﬁlled with brown cheese glue. I am holier than
thou. I shall abhor technology for the sake of this amusement-park historical
lifestyle.
</p><!--l. 8343--><p class="indent" >  All right, all right, perhaps she exaggerates. But jeeze. Lunch packets.
</p><!--l. 8346--><p class="indent" >  Wait. Does that mean people are leaving today? Has something changed?
</p><!--l. 8349--><p class="indent" >  She wanders through the tables, looking at the perfectly placed regiments of knives

and forks. The food does not inspire hunger in her, but hey:

</p>
  <div class="verbatim" id="verbatim-4">
BREAKFAST IS THE MOST IMPORTANT MEAL OF THE DAY!

<!--l. 8354--><p class="nopar" > Can&#x2019;t ﬂout tradition.
</p><!--l. 8357--><p class="indent" >  Mr. Muﬃns is here. He follows her into the room with practised nonchalance. This
boy – no young man, she should say, still has not introduced himself, but he spoke to
her yesterday. That is pretty amazing in itself. So she will introduce herself. Should
have done make-up ﬁrst, but too late now.
</p><!--l. 8363--><p class="indent" >  “Morning,” she sing-songs. “I&#x2019;m Sara. I am sure I know you from somewhere. . .but
I&#x2019;ve met so many people here. . .”
</p><!--l. 8366--><p class="indent" >  He nods, trying to appear as if the news is either uninteresting or he already knew
her name. In a normal person, she would have expected a laugh or a smile, but hell
this is tradition zone in the Norwegian mountains, where people have the manners of
sheep.
</p><!--l. 8371--><p class="indent" >  “Hello,” he says. “You look. . .”
</p><!--l. 8373--><p class="indent" >  “Ugh god! Don&#x2019;t say it! I knoo ah shoulda had ma hair did. . .”
</p><!--l. 8375--><p class="indent" >  “No, no. . .”
</p><!--l. 8377--><p class="indent" >  She laughs, enjoying his discomfort, but only for a brief moment. “Relax, . .
.?”.
</p><!--l. 8380--><p class="indent" >  “Frank,” he says.
</p><!--l. 8382--><p class="indent" >  “Is it okay if I sit here?”
</p><!--l. 8384--><p class="indent" >  “Would you like to join me for breakfast?”
</p><!--l. 8386--><p class="indent" >  Yes! Ten out of ten! No, be nice, girl.
</p><!--l. 8388--><p class="indent" >  “Okay,” she teases. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">After all, you are the most interesting thing in the room. </span>“If you
don&#x2019;t mind, that is.”
</p><!--l. 8392--><p class="indent" >  “No, I&#x2019;m sorry. Please. That would be . . . nice.”
</p><!--l. 8394--><p class="indent" >  Can&#x2019;t believe his luck. Where did I put those glasses? She pulls the chair out a little,
opposite his. “Just let me get something to eat.”
</p><!--l. 8398--><p class="indent" >  Now she has released an avalanche of uncertainty in him, as he shifts nervously,
wondering if his breath smells or his hair looks right. Relax, she thinks. It&#x2019;s just me.
Just need some company here.
</p><!--l. 8402--><p class="indent" >  Vibe strolls around the buﬀet, already bored with its contents. She picks up some
slices of bread, along with some cold meats and cucumber, a dollop of fruit preserve
and a boiled egg and some tea. She balances the lot on a plate and dumps it on the
table in front of him.
</p><!--l. 8408--><p class="indent" >  “I need coﬀee in the morning,” he observes.
</p><!--l. 8410--><p class="indent" >  She shakes her head. “Huh-uh. Coﬀee is bad. No good, no good on a mountain trip.
It just dries you out. Hot, weak tea. That&#x2019;s the ticket, laddie.”
</p><!--l. 8413--><p class="indent" >  He nods, a little shell-shocked by her playfulness.

</p><!--l. 8415--><p class="indent" >  “So what are you doing up here?” she asks him, before he asks her all
disapprovingly about her own movements.
</p><!--l. 8418--><p class="indent" >  “Watching,” he says.
</p><!--l. 8420--><p class="indent" >  “Watching?”
</p><!--l. 8422--><p class="indent" >  He gropes for an explanation.
</p><!--l. 8424--><p class="indent" >  “Ah, you&#x2019;re a voyeur. A pervert?”
</p><!--l. 8426--><p class="indent" >  His straight face breaks into a laugh. “Yes, that&#x2019;s it.”
</p><!--l. 8428--><p class="indent" >  “Well thank goodness we got that sorted out,” she winks.
</p><!--l. 8430--><p class="indent" >  He shakes his head. “No, no. I work up here at the moment.”
</p><!--l. 8433--><p class="indent" >  “At the cabin?”
</p><!--l. 8435--><p class="indent" >  “No. I am—an investigator.”
</p><!--l. 8437--><p class="indent" >  She examines him with a new ﬁlter. “Police?”
</p><!--l. 8439--><p class="indent" >  Eyes widen a little too much and a pang of guilt strikes. She should really have
contacted mountain rescue. . . She is probably in a bunch of trouble, if they ever
bother to catch up with her.
</p><!--l. 8443--><p class="indent" >  “Sort of.”
</p><!--l. 8445--><p class="indent" >  “So you&#x2019;re working?”
</p><!--l. 8447--><p class="indent" >  He nods. “As an underling, I get to be up here on watch.”
</p><!--l. 8449--><p class="indent" >  “Watching for what?”
</p><!--l. 8451--><p class="indent" >  He laughs. “Well, I can&#x2019;t say, but you can probably guess part of it.”
</p><!--l. 8453--><p class="indent" >  “It has to do with these football hooligans that are playing hide and seek?”
</p><!--l. 8456--><p class="indent" >  “Football hooligans?”
</p><!--l. 8458--><p class="indent" >  Damn, she thinks. I wasn&#x2019;t supposed to have seen them. “I think someone said these
gangs were. . .”
</p><!--l. 8461--><p class="indent" >  He laughs now, more of a smile than a laugh, “So you didn&#x2019;t see any sign of
them?”
</p><!--l. 8464--><p class="indent" >  She points two ﬁngers, like a pistol, at her head. “Oops.” A little smile. “I
saw they had painted their tribal colours in the snow. N-RBK-N. I assume
that means they are connected to the gang ﬁghts in international football
violence.”
</p><!--l. 8469--><p class="indent" >  He nods. “There is deﬁnitely a link, yes. But that&#x2019;s not really why I am here. I am
still waiting for something to happen. Stayed put yesterday. Have to move on
today.”
</p><!--l. 8473--><p class="indent" >  “Hmmm.” She races to swallow a mouthful. “So, are people moving out?”
</p><!--l. 8476--><p class="indent" >  He gestures to a ﬂat-screen on the wall behind her. Next to the weather forecast is a
message from the cabin crew. “Good news, everyone. Rescue says they have rounded
up members of two gangs, near here, and that it should be safe for people to
move on. They are recommending that everyone go back home, down the
mountain to the west. The season is almost over, and it looks as though we shall
be closing down early. Transportation can be arranged to pick up vehicles.
Bua.”
</p><!--l. 8485--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s good news. I have to move on today too.”

</p><!--l. 8487--><p class="indent" >  “So how come you are here? I thought they weren&#x2019;t letting anyone come up the
mountain.”
</p><!--l. 8490--><p class="indent" >  “Uhhmm. Well. . .” She grins with her teeth and feigned innocence. “I didn&#x2019;t strictly
come here with anyone&#x2019;s blessing.”
</p><!--l. 8493--><p class="indent" >  He nods with raised eyebrows. “I sort of guessed that.”
</p><!--l. 8495--><p class="indent" >  Really? Better watch this one. But he seems sweet and innocent. For now.
</p><!--l. 8497--><p class="indent" >  “What are you doing here?”
</p><!--l. 8499--><p class="indent" >  She remembers her own lot and her smile fades. “I&#x2019;m a student.”
</p><!--l. 8501--><p class="indent" >  “You came here to study.”
</p><!--l. 8503--><p class="indent" >  “Not exactly.”
</p><!--l. 8505--><p class="indent" >  He waits patiently, and she continues when he sees that he is not going to give it
up.
</p><!--l. 8508--><p class="indent" >  “You know these little robots that are being tested up here?”
</p><!--l. 8510--><p class="indent" >  He shakes his head.
</p><!--l. 8512--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s been in the news.”
</p><!--l. 8514--><p class="indent" >  “Oh. They&#x2019;re like something NASA built for exploration?”
</p><!--l. 8516--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, but they are testing them out here, for monitoring the environment, making
sure the pathways are properly marked, and for search and rescue. . . stuﬀ like
that.”
</p><!--l. 8520--><p class="indent" >  “And you are studying them.”
</p><!--l. 8522--><p class="indent" >  “I am working with the team that designed them,” she corrects. “I am designing part
of their programming.”
</p><!--l. 8525--><p class="indent" >  “Wow.” His eyes seem to lift her oﬀ her chair. “That&#x2019;s pretty amazing.”
</p><!--l. 8528--><p class="indent" >  She shrugs. “Not really. It&#x2019;s all pretty standard stuﬀ these days. But it is
kind of fun. I had to come up here, because they are not working properly
anymore.”
</p><!--l. 8532--><p class="indent" >  “Why not?”
</p><!--l. 8534--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t know. They have lost their controller. . .”
</p><!--l. 8536--><p class="indent" >  “I know the feeling. . .” he mutters.
</p><!--l. 8538--><p class="indent" >  “. . .and so they have started working without it. But that meant I lost contact with
them from Oslo. I only learned that yesterday.”
</p><!--l. 8541--><p class="indent" >  “Isn&#x2019;t there someone up here looking after them?”
</p><!--l. 8543--><p class="indent" >  “Huhh. There should be. There is supposed to be a team here, of French
technicians. I haven&#x2019;t actually met them. They deployed the robots and maintain them,
collect samples and double check analyses. Stuﬀ like that. I came here to meet them.
but they&#x2019;ve gone missing.”
</p><!--l. 8548--><p class="indent" >  He doesn&#x2019;t ask.
</p><!--l. 8550--><p class="indent" >  “That sounds a bit melodramatic, doesn&#x2019;t it. But I wish I knew where they
are.”
</p><!--l. 8553--><p class="indent" >  “Why do you think they are missing?”
</p><!--l. 8555--><p class="indent" >  “Well. I did get one message from them yesterday. It said to meet them tonight at
Leirvassbu.”
</p><!--l. 8558--><p class="indent" >  “And now you can go.”

</p><!--l. 8560--><p class="indent" >  She grins. “Now I can go.”
</p><!--l. 8562--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I am going in almost the same direction today. Perhaps we could walk
together.”
</p><!--l. 8565--><p class="indent" >  She smiles. “Thanks. That&#x2019;s kind, but I have to work on the way. I need to ﬁnd
some of my babies.”
</p><!--l. 8568--><p class="indent" >  “You know, it might still be risky walking alone. The mountain police are asking
people to go down the mountain, not go farther in.”
</p><!--l. 8572--><p class="indent" >  “And I am not exactly their favourite person. But I have to go. My life depends this.
I can&#x2019;t let a bunch of kids with water pistols ruin my degree.”

</p><!--l. 8584--><p class="indent" >  He looks anxious. Because of her safety, or because he likes me? “But you&#x2019;ll need
company right? I am going in almost the same direction.”
</p><!--l. 8587--><p class="indent" >  “No. Really. Look, I have been planning to meet this guy. It might not be a good
idea.”
</p><!--l. 8590--><p class="indent" >  “Oh. Okay. Well. I could walk with you a little while.”

foolishness. Looming cloud cover is threatening to spawn its devilry and the
darkening greys make the landscape more drab than picturesque.
</p><!--l. 8606--><p class="indent" >  All she sees, along the way, is a pair of German tourists; they also, apparently, have
disobeyed the mountain rescue&#x2019;s curfew. They nod a hello and continue on their way
without speaking, backpacks looking about four times too big, as though they are to
be here for a year at least. Vibe wonders if they have the entire transmitter base station
in there – perhaps they are the culprits? Perhaps they are foreign spies who have
been sent to retrieve it, like in James Bond? Perhaps she is bored with this
isolation.
</p><!--l. 8615--><p class="indent" >  The clanking of sheep-bells provides a relaxing break to the background of water
and wind; it lessens the monotony of clambering over stoney, uneven ground. The
sheep roam idly around these parts. They are tagged and marked, apparently
someone&#x2019;s property. She wonders how anyone ever catches them in an environment
such as this.

</p><!--l. 8622--><p class="indent" >  It&#x2019;s a full day&#x2019;s trip to Leirvassbu and she has come about half way. She has spent
the day watching the behaviour of these little robots in the cluster on her
mobile, comparing it to her simulation. It is a relaxing and useful time. It
is not really in her nature to court patience, but she is glad of the break, of
the time to think. It is interesting to see them climb this steep terrain both
slowly, and using balloons and sails, then use gravity itself to power their
descents.
</p><!--l. 8630--><p class="indent" >  She sees that she is nearing the main transmitter point. Curiosity insists that she
take a look to see what has happened. No response has been forthcoming
from the French, even though a simple answer from them could save her a
long trip. She is beginning to feel that she really understands these robots
perhaps even better than their creators. The experience yesterday and what she
saw in the game. . .it has given her some ideas. They have lost several of the
robots though. They are not easy to see, but they are obvious targets for the
gangs.
</p><!--l. 8640--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">They are supposed to be here!</span>
</p><!--l. 8642--><p class="indent" >  Vibe settles down on a boulder outcrop to eat her lunch. She has chosen the spot
because it is where a medium sized &#x2019;bot is located. It is wandering along the river
valley, in the soft muddy trails, spraying its paint, with micro-jabs, into large red ‘T&#x2019;s,
marking the tourist trail on conspicuous rocks. The T&#x2019;s are for tourist, but it is
tempting to think that they stand for ‘tombstone&#x2019; for all the places where mountain
walkers ran out of steam on the steep slopes.
</p><!--l. 8650--><p class="indent" >  The process takes some time, since it has to half-manufacture the paint along the
way, from the materials it has at hand. These machines are designed to run on
practically no power, so nothing they do seems like a day at the races, unless anyone
races pot plants. Nevertheless, it holds a certain fascination to watch cutting edge
technology at work.
</p><!--l. 8657--><p class="indent" >  Interfacing with the robot&#x2019;s network, she can see its nearest neighbours, farther up
the mountain. They have seen more action than this lucky valley dweller. From the
micro-cams, she can see that part of the neighbour&#x2019;s lens has been splashed with
paint.
</p><!--l. 8662--><p class="indent" >  She feels a blood-lust, a desire for revenge. Fuck these assholes with their guns. Go
back to your football stadiums if you want to ﬁght. The VeiVeks also have
paint guns, to paint the tourist T&#x2019;s on rocks. They could ﬁght back. If she
weren&#x2019;t afraid of losing more of them, she would write the program herself.
Divide and conquer. Two teams become ﬁve teams. And then it falls apart for
them.
</p><!--l. 8669--><p class="indent" >  What impresses her is how the robots have been able to adapt to their tasks and
protect themselves, even without explicit instructions from their overrated central
controller. They have not only adapted, but they seem to be continuing their
tasks as if nothing has happened. Looking at their action logs, she can see
that it is her original multi-agent programming that is at work, in failover
mode.

</p><!--l. 8676--><p class="indent" >  She was always opposed to the central control theory. It always struck her as ironic
that the roles were reversed in her collaboration. That the world&#x2019;s professed leader in
democracy should be insisting on imposing centralized control, while one of the
world&#x2019;s last remaining tightly regulating countries should be asking for autonomy,
virtual libertarianism.
</p><!--l. 8683--><p class="indent" >  Something has been happening here, something that could have destroyed her
chance of getting a degree, but which might actually save it inadvertently. She ﬁnds
herself teetering on the edge of wanting to go back to Oslo and wanting to stay and
make the most of this opportunity.
</p><!--l. 8689--><p class="indent" >  Something about the behaviour of agents is going on that she needs to resolve.
Suddenly her simulation is not just about the VeiVeks, but there are human agents
too. She needs to factor them in to understand their responses. Part of her
is excited; after all, this was her original idea, to test the robots without a
central controller. She smiles at the insight that she always gets her way in the
end.
</p><!--l. 8696--><p class="indent" >  She needs to see what happened to the transmitter.
</p><!--l. 8699--><p class="indent" >  Text to Bea: “Thinking of going up the mountain.”
</p><!--l. 8701--><p class="indent" >  Reply comes back: “Don&#x2019;t forget your rope!”
</p><!--l. 8703--><p class="indent" >  It is their private joke. Inept mountain walkers somehow believe that you need to
have ropes and stuﬀ to climb mountains. It&#x2019;s not like we&#x2019;re climbing Everest or
anything. Zig zagging up the slopes on sheep-worn trails works just ﬁne, watching out
for the quicksilver patches of ice frozen onto the stones from the previous storm. This
is a dangerous time of year to be here.
</p><!--l. 8710--><p class="indent" >  “To hang myself with?” she replies.

<!--l. 8716--><p class="indent" >  By some twist of fate, Vibe seems to have always had her right ear to every loud
noise, every open window and every shouting voice. Now she can hear diﬀerently
through her two ears; a subtle timbre discrepancy and perhaps a diﬀerent clarity,
almost a diﬀerence in her ability to understand sound. She is not sure if she can
actually hear better or worse, but she can hear a diﬀerence. There is something more
real about the sound from her right ear.
</p><!--l. 8724--><p class="indent" >  But now, she can hardly believe either of them. It is quiet in the air. No, not just
quiet. Utterly silent. Only when she moves, does she hear the rustling of her own
clothing, her heavy backpack. When the wind stops, in the mountains, when nothing
is moving except for the almost indiscernible ﬂedgling ﬂakes of snow, the air seems to
suck the sound out of the world.
</p><!--l. 8731--><p class="indent" >  Now she knows what it is like to be in outer space. In the hall of the gods. It is like
standing in the anechoic chamber she worked in, as part of her physics classes at

College. There is a complete absence of sound that feels so strange, so alien, that the
pressure inside her head seems to want to escape. Decompression. It is like being in a
vacuum.
</p><!--l. 8738--><p class="indent" >  It hurts her ears.
</p><!--l. 8740--><p class="indent" >  And then, it begins to snow.
</p><!--l. 8742--><p class="indent" >  At the base of the mountain, on which the main controller transmitter should be
located, Sara feels and deals with a palpable sense of awe. The apparently impossible
challenge of reaching the summit of this towering peak is only a barrier in her mind.
The feeling is one of dread and excitement, mixed with an irresistible energy. The
power of the sensation is almost sexual; she senses a tingling down below at the
primality of the experience.
</p><!--l. 8750--><p class="indent" >  This challenge, like all challenges, is solved by looking far ahead into the
goal, and by putting one foot in front of the other, concentrating on each
step of the path. The sum of many short steps is a long journey. As long as
you are going in the right direction, the details are not important. You will
arrive.
</p><!--l. 8757--><p class="indent" >  Each stone is an obstacle, but each brings her closer to her goal. All together, they
are insurmountable; one by one, they are trivial. This is the hacker&#x2019;s code, she thinks. I
shall hack you, mountain.
</p><!--l. 8761--><p class="indent" >  Her stomach hurts too, just to remind her that she is not the master of everything.
Nature is still laughing at her. She loathes that time of the month. It hardly seems fair,
under the circumstances, to add insult to injury. You&#x2019;d think that someone would have
found a way to stop these unpleasant biological processes by now. But she always has
her way. She is not so easily manipulated.
</p><!--l. 8768--><p class="indent" >  Then snow begins to fall heavily.
</p><!--l. 8770--><p class="indent" >  As she plods up the relentless incline, she enters the familiar dreamy meditation of
walking, hardly noticing the path she is following. Half of her mind detaches and
ponders the developments of the last two weeks.
</p><!--l. 8774--><p class="indent" >  Imagine, she thinks, the disruption of these criminal vandals by our little robotic
guerrillas. To make these little machines trick humans, humans driven by simple
motivations, into acting out diﬀerent scenario. Not the one they have planned, but one
that fragments them and makes them self destruct. To tease them into a diﬀerent
game. She knows that it is possible. She and Bea have played this strategy in the
VR.
</p><!--l. 8781--><p class="indent" >  It is just a matter of adding some new states, of extending the global transition
matrix to model the humans like dumb agents. It is not as if they are behaving as
intelligent problem-solvers; they are just slaves to some simple minded doctrines,
reacting like insects, and doing very well.
</p><!--l. 8787--><p class="indent" >  Build some new closures. Bend the top level rules. The humans become part of the
simulation. The VeiVeks could inﬁltrate them implicitly. They would never know they
were being played.
</p><!--l. 8791--><p class="indent" >  The dorks were herding her with paint balls. She could herd them with her babies,
except that they are supposed to have gone now. The world is playing this game all the

time, she thinks.
</p><!--l. 8795--><p class="indent" >  Wind returns in subtle chimes, as she climbs. At ﬁrst it is pendulous, growing in
intensity as if on a build-up to a ﬁnal tidal explosion of ice. Then, as she comes over
the rise, it seems to blast like a continuous signal. Cold, half-wet snow assails her bare
ﬂesh. She pulls up the hood on her jacket and winces to keep stinging snowﬂakes out
of her eyes.
</p><!--l. 8802--><p class="indent" >  Racing air expands in its assault, threatening to blow her away, as she passes over
the rim of a half-plateau. It wants to guide her implicitly, pushing her away from
her real goal. That is how you inﬂuence a herd, she thinks. This is how to
control the unwilling: a constant pressure, a relentless push. This is what
marketeers do with their brain-dead advertising campaigns. This is what
she can do with her little agents. The wind and the tide. She would smile
at the simplicity of it, were it not for the cramped paralysis in her frozen
face.
</p><!--l. 8812--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I could patent this</span>, she smiles hypothetically.
</p><!--l. 8814--><p class="indent" >  “Yes,” she says to herself. The bloody taste of her gasping breath makes her
swallow. “Yes.” That&#x2019;s it.
</p><!--l. 8817--><p class="indent" >  On the plateau, rainy snow sleets and the wind gusts. She feels exposed here. Alone
again. Where is the support that she is supposed to feel from her advisors? You just
think this is a waste of time.
</p><!--l. 8821--><p class="indent" >  A gust of wind slices through her clothing, breaking her absent thought, and the
world darkens from fantasy into hard, wet, mossy stone, freckled with fastening
snowﬂakes. Pain and cold. A gripping world of sensation, near the top of this little
mountain: the experience is a privilege shared by few these days. She should embrace
it rather than abhor it. There is no cleaner, sharper reality than a trip to the mountains,
she thinks.
</p><!--l. 8829--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Look at me now, Mr. Hart, Mr. Lindgren, you wouldn&#x2019;t understand. How could you?</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">There are people out here doing real work here and your divine jobs are just to get in</span>
<span

</p><!--l. 8835--><p class="indent" >  <span

<span

<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">experience is the key. </span>No amount of simulation could teach her what she is learning
here.
</p><!--l. 8840--><p class="indent" >  She pauses for breath only brieﬂy. It does not do to stop when you are plodding up
an incline. You might never start again.
</p><!--l. 8843--><p class="indent" >  The control transmitter for the VeiVeks should be located up here, according to her
mobile. It should be a small tower structure, like a trig&#x2019; point, at the local summit of
this hill, clamped with metal ties to prevent it being blown away. This is the main
transmitter for remote controlling and monitoring the little robots. It is not
registering on any frequencies, so it is certainly not working. But is it even
here?
</p><!--l. 8850--><p class="indent" >  Onward and upward. Ad astra.

</p><!--l. 8852--><p class="indent" >  The temperature has fallen sharply again, and the snow is sticking now.
</p><!--l. 8855--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I should be going down, not up</span>, she thinks.
</p><!--l. 8857--><p class="indent" >  The icy wind begins to make the top of her head ache with cold, her nose is full of
ice crystals. Fine snow dust, too cold to form large ﬂakes, blows like desert sand
across the path ahead, threatening to bury it, swirling in little eddies. She should get
out of here, before it starts to get dangerous.
</p><!--l. 8863--><p class="indent" >  She has been caught unawares in bad weather before, been so cold to the bone
that even the slightest movement hurt, and those parts of her body which
could still feel at all, were tender to the slightest touch. She doesn&#x2019;t want that
again.
</p><!--l. 8868--><p class="indent" >  It should be here soon. Her frozen, shaking hands pull a gap between her gloves
and jacket to look at the wrist band screen. Her mobile conﬁrms that this is
the place. She is close. It should be here. She wanders around, as visibility
worsens. She does not have long left before she will have to turn around and go
back.
</p><!--l. 8874--><p class="indent" >  Then she sees it: a cairn, a little Darth Varder, where a shelter has been built, from
loose boulders lying around it. She jogs towards it, bending stiﬀ, frozen knees. A few
wires, a brace, tied to the rock, a mounting bracket. This is where the transmitter
should be. But not anymore.
</p><!--l. 8880--><p class="indent" >  A few fragments, barely a trace.
</p><!--l. 8882--><p class="indent" >  The control transmitter is gone.

</p><!--l. 8888--><p class="indent" >  Something is growing in the clouds; dense, thick cumulonimbus clouds, but high
up. A column of yellowy, sulphurous discolouration. From 25,000 feet (why do they
still measure altitude in feet?), she can not see much, nor make out what it
is.
</p><!--l. 8893--><p class="indent" >  “What is that?” she asks the woman next to her.
</p><!--l. 8895--><p class="indent" >  “What is what?”
</p><!--l. 8897--><p class="indent" >  “That,” she says, pointing. Her neighbour glances at the place brieﬂy and shrugs.
“Hmm. I don&#x2019;t know.” Then it is back to her magazine.
</p><!--l. 8901--><p class="indent" >  Preeta sighs inside herself as if to say: Why are people not more curious? How can
that magazine, full of petty, concocted intrigue be more interesting?
</p><!--l. 8905--><p class="indent" >  Coming in to land over London, the plane descends below the cloud cover,
revealing ﬂat watery ﬁelds, with river tendrils snaking dendritically outward in smooth
meanders. It really is a green and pleasant land, she thinks. Well, green and brown,
actually. The agricultural patchwork is almost perfect. A mosaic of cultivated ﬁelds,
tiled and shuﬄed.
</p><!--l. 8912--><p class="indent" >  Patches of forest punctuate the landscape, cooped up with British orderliness. The
villages, or at least their rooftops, look like archaeological ruins of a Roman wall, And
all over, small oxbow lakes are the ruins of formerly vital rivers; the bend which fell
oﬀ the snake, a trick of Möbius.
</p><!--l. 8918--><p class="indent" >  “Are you returning to the U.K.?” the woman asks her.
</p><!--l. 8920--><p class="indent" >  “No it&#x2019;s my ﬁrst time,” she says simply. These are the ﬁrst words they have uttered
in the eight or nine hours of the journey.
</p><!--l. 8923--><p class="indent" >  As the plane enters London, the probing avenues of the city carve sculptures across
the landscape. They are clearly visible from up here. They wind and curve
organically like the fossilized remains of long-extinct life-forms, not like
the ramshackle chaos of Asia, nor the orderly lattice-work of a city as in
Manhattan. It looks organic, but not wild, not out of control—more like an
organism, curled up along side the river and that petriﬁed into bricks and

mortar, or an English garden made of stone. Is this the remains of Empire? she
wonders.
</p><!--l. 8933--><p class="indent" >  Her ﬂight is drawn into ventricle four of the heart of this beast; it is still pumping
people and aeroplanes around its diseased corpus after all this time, even as the
memory of empire fades and withers. Heathrow looks huge, like a city in its
own right. But it looks completely alien: a world in which people ﬂow like
blood through little arterial corridors, arriving in brightly coloured vessels,
carrying this breath, this life-force into and out of a weary angina-ridden pump,
docking with the alveoli of its pulmonary terminals to recharge them for a new
journey.
</p><!--l. 8943--><p class="indent" >  Please wait until the plane comes to a complete standstill. . .and then rush for the
exit like a ramshackle invasion force.
</p><!--l. 8946--><p class="indent" >  Preeta disembarks (or ‘deplanes&#x2019; as her American neighbour calls it, seeming
to imply some kind of parasitic encumbrance), into the newly refurbished
terminal feeling both the uncertainty of the unknown and excitement of the
new.
</p><!--l. 8951--><p class="indent" >  She is pumped through the terminal.
</p><!--l. 8953--><p class="indent" >  Time passes quickly in the ﬂow. All she can see ahead is a queue of bodies, lining
up to pass through the security scanner ahead. They look like the crowds of refugees
she has seen in pictures of the conﬂicts: sad, tired people staggering towards an
inevitable fate. They look crumpled, having been packed into their long distance
carriers like so much waste-paper in a dumpster. They look like her, as she was before
her escape.
</p><!--l. 8961--><p class="indent" >  A man bumps into a child, who drops an ice-cream on a small island of tiles in an
otherwise carpeted ﬂoor. The fallen whip leaves an arty smear of raspberry whirl,
spread out in a creamy ﬂame, like some primordial galactic explosion, forged in the
very spark of creation. A temporal ray is ﬁred into the æther from these spacetime
coordinates.
</p><!--l. 8968--><p class="indent" >  She can almost see it happening as if, somehow, in slow motion. From this incident,
great things will result; wheels will turn, continents will slide and time itself will carry
the responsibility of redemption. The child&#x2019;s happiness shatters, ﬁrst into automatic
but embryonic tears, which falter and dry as an unusual beauty in the pattern seduces
his instinct for aesthetics. From the memory of this incident, the child is destined to
follow that ray. He has been marked by fate; he will go on to make great works of art,
championing a modern, expressionistic style of explosive colour. At this
great nexus interchange, at this heart of the airwaves, wheels of fate are set
in motion, so as to change the world. Preeta is here, at the hub. She saw it
happen.
</p><!--l. 8981--><p class="indent" >  The queue does not seem to be abating and the minutes are falling like the
autumn leaves. Why is she stressed by this delay? After all she has been
through, why should this aﬀect her? She could miss her connection, yes, but
what could possibly happen to compare with the trials and threats she has
endured?

</p><!--l. 8987--><p class="indent" >  This is just a part of her adventure. She should savour the moment. Perhaps it is the
sense that she now has a duty to perform, that is to say: a duty that was oﬀered freely,
as a choice rather than as an obligation.
</p><!--l. 8993--><p class="indent" >  Everything seems too small.
</p><!--l. 8995--><p class="indent" >  She imagined huge halls and grand open spaces, ultra-modern design, and
everything run with military precision and grave superiority. Instead, she sees people
laughing and joking informally, chatting about their wives and husbands, as though
they were hanging over the garden fence with their neighbours in some city
slum.
</p><!--l. 9001--><p class="indent" >  For a people with the reputation for having revolutionized the world with the
machinery of industry, the British are not what she would have expected.
They seem almost ﬂippant and self derogatory. There is no pride in these
faces, just complacency. “Duty free, anyone? Spirits, perfumes, used cars. .
.?”
</p><!--l. 9007--><p class="indent" >  London is supposed to be a big city. Here it seems as though the airport walkways
were designed for little people. The curiously British carpeting in these hallways
makes the journey to her next ﬂight seem like a trek along the hallway of someone&#x2019;s
house to visit the bathroom.

<!--l. 9017--><p class="indent" >  Wrist-mobile, searching for a new service: it pauses with a reconﬁguration
challenge. Is she willing to install and run a VCA here? The Pervasive Environment
Service (aﬀectionately known as the PES dispenser) understands the need for

<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">have </span>on your mobile as long as you run a voluntary cooperation agent that

cooperate with the security system, it will be isolated and you can even be
deported.
</p><!--l. 9028--><p class="indent" >  Out of the security embolism, squirted into the lungs of the beast, she scans the
airport terminal for a bookshop, for something new and challenging to read. Amidst
the perfume and cosmetics, she ﬁnds one. It has a good selection of books here, both
paper and digital. Novels, new and old. Science, biography. Politics. Noam Chomsky,
Arundhati Roy. . .these are people who see through the crap. You would never
ﬁnd these books on the shelves of her local bookstore. Maybe in Singapore.
She laps up these classic books about power struggles. Preeta has seen her
share of political struggle. She can identify almost anyone&#x2019;s struggle with her
own.
</p><!--l. 9039--><p class="indent" >  After she ﬂed her family, and began to study, she belonged to an anti-dam

movement. These were the books she valued then. She is well acquainted with the
ways in which the Indian government has twisted words and arguments to get their
way—to convince the people that they are really working in their best interests, when
really they are just feathering the nests of the ruling elite. All governments are surely
the same. Some of them believe that those ideals are compatible: that a ruling elite&#x2019;s
pleasure is the way forward for the poor also, but the ﬁfty million people,
forcibly displaced and impoverished to start those dam projects, are now
kept silent. Now, the job that she was being asked to do is no diﬀerent to
that. It is just another propaganda engine. It made her day, even as a child to
see the BJP so humiliated by the poor – when Sonya Ghandi, an Italian for
heaven&#x2019;s sake, has done what everyone thought was impossible and won the
election. Our right wing values have made India prosperous and modern,
at least for 17 percent of the population. The rest will drown in the ﬂood
plains.
</p><!--l. 9058--><p class="indent" >  It seems so distant now; her senses are saturating in this new adventure. She is a
collage, a curry of leftovers from other people&#x2019;s plans and wishes. She has not so
much chosen her adventures as been driven from place to place, running for her
freedom at each juncture. Now she is oﬀ again.
</p><!--l. 9064--><p class="indent" >  The terminal seems to be full of people from the Indian subcontinent, working in
the shops and running airport services. They seem to form a subcontinent of their
own. Did they also ﬂee from their pasts?
</p><!--l. 9068--><p class="indent" >  The travellers, on the other hand, are a diﬀerent race. Here, amongst them, she feels
that she has entered a diﬀerent plane of existence. No pun intended. The people here
walk as if in a trance, holding mobiles and talking distantly to voices in another realm.
They look happy, deliberate or sometimes stressed, but they show no sign of
being aware of the physical realm around them. It portends of a nightmare
scenario.
</p><!--l. 9076--><p class="indent" >  It is fortunate that we are not truly telepathic, she thinks. There should be an
oﬀ-switch, even if people don&#x2019;t always know how to use it. Without it, no-one would
never meet physically. They would loathe one another, ﬁnd each other repellant. <span

through one another like ghosts, never have sex, never have children. The race would
die out. She hopes that it is just a function of the airport to holds these lost
spirits. Somehow the bustling immediacy of Asia seems less oppressive than it
did.
</p><!--l. 9086--><p class="indent" >  She checks the time, NTP adjusted for zone and daylight saving. Two hours to go
before her connecting ﬂight. She looks at her pale beige slacks and open topped
sandals. It is warm here in the airport, but she almost perished in the antarctic winter
of the ﬂight.
</p><!--l. 9091--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I have to get clothes.</span>
</p><!--l. 9093--><p class="indent" >  She is going from one of the hottest places on the planet to one of the coldest. She
needs warm clothes and shoes, and her mystery X has even supplied her with a little
money for her relocation.

</p><!--l. 9097--><p class="indent" >  She walks along the concourse of the terminal.
</p><!--l. 9099--><p class="indent" >  The clothes shops are mostly high fashion, business garbs, suits. She needs
something warm, not something audacious and brightly coloured. There are
virtual warehouses ﬁlled with bottled scents, perfumes and colognes; music
and video entertainment, chocolate and periodicals are stacked up by the
shop-load. She ﬁnds all the same brands Kit-Kat, Coco Cola, Pepsi, Cadbury,
Nestlé, Evian. Probably she should not even be thinking these names; they
are registered TM thoughts. Burger King, Pret à manger? Sounds like an
invitation to wantonly vandalize the Christian nativity? Fine marmalades and
preserves, meats and luxury foods. Harrods. Starbucks. Sock shop. Tie shop.
Sushi.
</p><!--l. 9110--><p class="indent" >  All the brands.
</p><!--l. 9112--><p class="indent" >  No practical clothes.
</p><!--l. 9114--><p class="indent" >  Billboard photographs of fashion models, like the stylized apparitions in fashion
magazines: compare them to the faces in the terminal. They are not alike. Terminal
people have skin texture, like Asians. The coloured shadows around the eyes are not
always there. They are not as decorative. The travelling women are not as concerned
with the signal they are projecting as the posterized avant garde. Why should they be?
They do not even notice one another.
</p><!--l. 9122--><p class="indent" >  Preeta wanders about the concourse, avoiding the small electric cars with their
annoying piezo-electric ticks, mowing down travellers relentlessly and for no apparent
reason. She ﬁnds tweed costumes for the English gentleman, Philippa K.
fashion and design. Clothes for men. Fashion for women. She ﬁnds a shoe shop
selling high heeled decanters, stiletto vases, and warm boots, Hope springs
eternal. The prices mean little to her, but she knows her budget and she has
been warned to ﬁnd something. This does not seem to be the place to buy
clothes to survive in. These are clothes to parade in, to negotiate in, to seduce
in.
</p><!--l. 9133--><p class="indent" >  She has not owned a coat designed for warmth since she was a child. Preeta ﬁnds a
sweater that looks warm and not too ungainly and buys it out of desperation, along
with a pair of fur lined boots. She will have to survive with a poorly matched woollen
frock and feet stuﬀed into Koala bears. Besides, it is surely better to buy clothes in
the country she is going to. That way, she knows that they will be the right
kind.
</p><!--l. 9141--><p class="indent" >  The wandering makes her legs ache and the dry air of the ﬂight has dehydrated her.
Preeta realizes that she is thirsty and she sees people sitting by huge windows, looking
out at the airﬁeld. She feels attracted by a sitting group of people. Humanity. Not
molecules in transit.
</p><!--l. 9147--><p class="indent" >  The lure of daylight is strong in her after the long journey in venal captivity. This
discoloured electrical phosphorescence is no excuse for the missing sun. It is not light
and it is barely illumination. It is not here to nourish but to deprive: to make all the
goods and glitter shine by comparison to the gloom of the Lung. Well, she needs to
glimpse the other side of the membrane.

</p><!--l. 9154--><p class="indent" >  There is a roar from the light-bathed coﬀee shop lounge. Ahead, a group of
travellers is momentarily united in involuntary frenzy, releasing animal instincts so
immaculately pent up by voluntary solitary conﬁnement. She sees a green splash of a
soccer game on the board. It is an ugly sport; not much of an improvement on the days
when Mayan citizens kicked the skulls of criminals around their ziggurats. She prefers
swimming, if anything.
</p><!--l. 9162--><p class="indent" >  She sits down with her cup of chai, fortune acquiring her a seat in front of the
window. Chai does not smell quite right, but it is hot and wet. It is the ﬁrst time that
she has felt able to relax in the last week. Chai, milk. Sugar.
</p><!--l. 9167--><p class="indent" >  A moment of solitude in a crowd. She loosens her wrist strap and taps her mobile
out of sleep mode. She sees her name. She sees messages. She recalls her
death.

<!--l. 9175--><p class="indent" >  To her family, Preeta is dead.
</p><!--l. 9177--><p class="indent" >  She was born in Srinagar, just before the turn of the millennium, and spent the ﬁrst
eighteen years of her life there, happy and accepting of life, of what it seemed to be.
In the beginning it seemed to be a happy time, a place to run and play and
learn at the local library or video complex. Then she grew older; they all
did.
</p><!--l. 9183--><p class="indent" >  Slowly, she saw her brothers and sisters married oﬀ and sold like cured meats, in a
pitiful play of antiquated family politics, in the wailing death throes of an antiquated
and corruptly micro-managed society.
</p><!--l. 9188--><p class="indent" >  It was not all according to her parents&#x2019; plan. Her brother spent a week in a prison
cell for exhibiting excessive ﬂamboyance at his wedding. Rules and more stupid
rules. The chef&#x2019;s union allows no more than 7 dishes at a wedding, or the
family can be ﬁned. He refused to listen to their objections, and ended up
punching one of regulators on the nose for interfering with his decadence.
The inspectors said they were preserving the modesty of their culture and
that the men in her family were ﬂagrantly abusing their status. Mr. Mustafa
complained to the police about her brother, and Sanjiv was thrown in gaol by the
elders.
</p><!--l. 9199--><p class="indent" >  Later it was her turn. But she did not want to be married oﬀ into a dead-end
life of ignorance and pre-arranged domestic servitude. She pleaded with her
father.
</p><!--l. 9203--><p class="indent" >  When she ﬁrst complained, he told her that she was foolish and he struck her. Her
brothers bombarded her with macho-vellian bullying, whining about a tradition they
have learned by rote. That was when she resolved to leave for Singapore. For a life in
a free world. They tried to lock her up in a room of the house. When she ran away,

they could not accept the shame of her refusal, to be forced into marriage. Though
they did not, could not kill her, she is disowned, rejected, eradicated. Family
honour.
</p><!--l. 9212--><p class="indent" >  She met visiting relatives as a child, relatives who had ﬂed to Norway, as refugees.
It was years ago, but she never met foreigners other than tourists before moving to
Bangalore to make her new life. Strange that she should be travelling there
now.
</p><!--l. 9217--><p class="indent" >  She found her way as far as Bangalore, by catching a lift with a fat man who looked
at her small frame with an ugly repressed hunger, so clearly signalled by his shortness
of breath and barking suggestion. However much it pains her to admit it, she owes
a debt of gratitude to Mota. He was a basically decent man and she took
advantage of his frustrations, shamelessly, even as he took advantage of her skills
with computers. He arranged for her a job, and she was able to ﬁnish her
education and make some money. One day she will go back and thank him
properly.
</p><!--l. 9227--><p class="indent" >  So what is she running to now? What would she like to be? Excessive, lively,
unrestrained and outspoken. Moved beyond the threshold of passion. Is that what she
will ﬁnd here in the West?
</p><!--l. 9231--><p class="indent" >  Where can she ﬁnd a warm coat?

<!--l. 9239--><p class="indent" >  Violent words ricochet oﬀ the airwaves. Another threatening message arrives for
her. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">We are watching you. </span>Threats. Why exactly do they bother? She has lived with
threats for half her life. What does she have to lose by leaving? What do they hope to
accomplish with these threats? We are watching you? Clearly they are not, since she
has come this far.
</p><!--l. 9246--><p class="indent" >  They did not expect her to get out of the country, surely. So she beat them.
</p><!--l. 9248--><p class="indent" >  Didn&#x2019;t she?
</p><!--l. 9250--><p class="indent" >  She has known about the existence of small time gangs, of course. Her own
apartment in Kuala Lumpur has been broken into more than once by home-raiders, but
she has been fortunate to be absent during the raids. Lately there have been girl gangs
and there are rumours that the Russian maﬁa has moved in and taken over parts of the
high tech operations. Preeta has never paid much attention to such talk. She would
rather not know about this dark side of her world. But the meteorite seems to have
landed in her front room.
</p><!--l. 9259--><p class="indent" >  Perhaps it was only a matter of time before her high proﬁle company, and its
dealings with online gaming, became known. And she has been a key person in that
work, perhaps by good luck, for whatever reason.
</p><!--l. 9263--><p class="indent" >  The messages have been arriving at irregular intervals, terrorising her, threatened to

beat and rape her. In return for safety, she would give them access to users&#x2019; identities.
The theft of self. When you own someone&#x2019;s identity, you own all that they have. The
virtual reality game gives them a completely new pathway to this kind of extortion.
Just as the game consortium would like to use the game for manipulating
opinion, so these criminal organizations want to use it for a more direct theft of
individuality.
</p><!--l. 9272--><p class="indent" >  Planes are moving out there. White missiles towed across a cloudy sky. They
accelerate impossibly and lift their tonnes of fuselage high into the gathering
darkness. The brightly coloured tail ﬁns of their brothers and sisters, on the ground,
are lined up like an odd avant garde art installation: painted animals tied up at the
corral, just like in the Westerns. Preeta breathes uneasily and feels exposed, grateful
for her apparent escape from shackles and threats, but uneasy about where she is
headed.
</p><!--l. 9281--><p class="indent" >  She needs to talk to Claire Thambusamy. She dials in the VR, on sound only,
bouncing her call oﬀ the forwarding base that she left behind in her workstation. It
will make her call appear to come from within Kuala Lumpur. She does not want to
hasten the discovery of her departure by her pursuers. She wants to hear what is
happening at home. Home?
</p><!--l. 9288--><p class="indent" >  “Has he forgiven me yet? What happened with the visitors?”
</p><!--l. 9290--><p class="indent" >  She tells her that the visitors have been digging into their organization, asking after
her. They can see that something is not going according to plan and they are
worried about the security of the game. They are missing her. She should come
by.
</p><!--l. 9295--><p class="indent" >  It was a mistake for Mota to send her home. Now he cannot get her back.
</p><!--l. 9298--><p class="indent" >  She tells Claire that she thinks she has been threatened by a criminal gang and that
they should all be careful. Claire is shocked and worried. Preeta tells her that she will
lie low for a while. She says nothing more.
</p><!--l. 9302--><p class="indent" >  Then she sends a message to her contact—to her mystery X. They send her a code
and she installs it. It is safe to talk openly now.
</p><!--l. 9305--><p class="indent" >  A moment of panic rises through her calm acceptance of his promises.
She knows of stories of girls who have been lured into foreign countries
by the maﬁa, had their travel credentials conﬁscated and forced to work in
prostitution. Locked away in rooms without money or clothes. Beaten if they try to
escape.
</p><!--l. 9311--><p class="indent" >  Suddenly there is the thought that she might have been tricked here, out of one
maﬁa operation and into another. Is that to be the new function of the game? Sex
traﬃcking? But it doesn&#x2019;t seem likely. That only happens to girls and children who do
not have jobs, who are destitute and desperate. This was not like that. And
the country, Norway has a reputation for international justice. She is partly
reassured.
</p><!--l. 9318--><p class="indent" >  She tells her X that she does not want to give up her travel credentials, that she has
not been able to ﬁnd any clothes to buy. She wants to tell him that she is afraid, but
that would suggest too much trust. Instead she says that she is looking forward to

having a room of her own with a shower.
</p><!--l. 9324--><p class="indent" >  X tells her: “You will meet with our coordinator in Oslo. He will meet you at the
airport in Oslo. His name is Edward Bishop. He works for the Norwegian F.B.I..
Don&#x2019;t worry, our agents are watching your progress to make sure that you are not
being followed.”
</p><!--l. 9329--><p class="indent" >  They probably wouldn&#x2019;t be helping her if they didn&#x2019;t think she could help them
with their own problems. What are they doing for the girls in Bangkok or Bosnia or
Murmansk?
</p><!--l. 9334--><p class="indent" >  Preeta always thought that Malaysia was pretty up&#x2019;n&#x2019;coming. More like the
West than the gangs of Mumbai. She begins to reevaluate her view of the
world.
</p><!--l. 9338--><p class="indent" >  When you grow up in a box, you have a strange world view. On the one hand, you
yearn for freedom, but on the other the thought of it scares you stiﬀ. Where are you
going to put your boundaries? How far can you go? Is it safe? What is she headed
for?
</p><!--l. 9343--><p class="indent" >  What is she doing?

<!--l. 9350--><p class="indent" >  Flung back into the aero-spatial aorta, she ﬁnds herself across the North Sea,
terriﬁed, in a rattling jet, huge gaping vents opening in the wings. The aircraft depletes
into Gardemoen airport in its so-called controlled descent.
</p><!--l. 9355--><p class="indent" >  She falls into a snowy forest, with rivers and trees and broken mirrors of water,
reﬂecting an ebbing orb of struggling light. The plane re-enters a human sphere from
clear blue freedom, plunging her into a winter world, with winter hearts and wintery
faces.
</p><!--l. 9362--><p class="indent" >  “Preeta Dhawan? My name is Ed Bishop. It is a pleasure to ﬁnally meet you. We
have been talking for some time. We shall look after you here.”
</p><!--l. 9365--><p class="indent" >  Preeta has not seen many white men or girls so close. Strange to see them now in
the ﬂesh: that pasty skin, milky white and ghostly. And the freckles. Is that some kind
of disease? She is both fascinated and perplexed. It has an oddly attractive quality.
Sexy is not a word she would have been allowed to use anywhere in her past, but here
there is no other word that will do. She feels drab and out of place. She is too dark.
She needs new clothes.
</p><!--l. 9374--><p class="indent" >  “We have found you an apartment in the centre of town for now. It&#x2019;s student
accommodation, but it is quite comfortable. It is close to the medical centre, and
to the Asian community region of the city. And a short distance from our
team.”
</p><!--l. 9379--><p class="indent" >  “You can get settled in and I&#x2019;ll take you to where you&#x2019;ll be working tomorrow.”
</p><!--l. 9381--><p class="indent" >  “I have only managed to get a temporary visa for you,” he adds. “It lasts for three

months. We&#x2019;ll see how it goes after that.”
</p><!--l. 9384--><p class="indent" >  Thank you for your help.
</p><!--l. 9386--><p class="indent" >  “Oh – one more thing. I brought you a fresh mobile, with network access. It will
help you to settle in and ﬁnd your way around.”
</p><!--l. 9389--><p class="indent" >  She nods, afraid to say thank you too any times. A new identity suddenly sounds
like a perfect idea.
</p><!--l. 9392--><p class="indent" >  I have grown tired of conformity, she thinks.
</p><!--l. 9394--><p class="indent" >  I am bored with myself.

</p><!--l. 9401--><p class="indent" >  Fresh cantaloupe, water melon, pineapple. English muﬃn grilled with butter and
cheese. The young waiter regarded him strangely and, without inquiry, returned
with a sliced and toasted blueberry cup-cake, with a plate of butter and a
slice of processed cheese. Apparently no great violence was done, in his
mind, by cremating the muﬃn, but the thought of putting cheese on it was too
much like draping the ﬂag over a corpse. When Den explained about English
muﬃns, he was re-instructed by his supervisor, and the perfect breakfast
ensued.
</p><!--l. 9411--><p class="indent" >  Seldom has Den felt so alive as he does now, here on this San Diego hotel
patio.
</p><!--l. 9425--><p class="indent" >  The last few days have been a ‘roller-coaster&#x2019;, as his American hosts would say, a
ride of curious ambivalence towards his new friends. America is a lively study in
contradictions.
</p><!--l. 9438--><p class="indent" >  This wanton love child, sired in the ultimate blending of American beauties: a
ménage à trois horriblis of ﬂedgling divorcees: Silicon Valley, The Pentagon, and
Hollywood, has taken on a life of its own. Now heading for adolescence, having seen
some of the world, the progenitors are scrambling to save their creation from moral
corruption at the hands of inﬁdels in the cheap outsourcing nanny countries. Isn&#x2019;t it
the ultimate irony? The very nations the corporate West relies on, to power its bloated
lifestyle, are the incubators of terror and instability, so untrusted and yet so exploited
by the fear-mongers of Washington.
</p><!--l. 9450--><p class="indent" >  And what about this trio? Silicon Valley and the Pentagon are no surprise, but
Hollywood? As David Bowie understood, even in the nineteen seventies, it was the
corporate Mickey Mouse&#x2019;s destiny, albeit on America&#x2019;s tortured brow, to
become the cash-cow of its creator, Disney. But now, with a little genetic
manipulation, the government has morphed Mickey into a virtual reality simulation
of more bullish proportions. It is not just a cash cow, but a multi-headed
Hydra guarding the entrance to the Golden Fleecing. If not life from Mars,

then the next best phoney future-scape to rival any of Bowie&#x2019;s seventies bad

People, out of place in this utopia of money and power. A tall thin man, with
short-clipped balding hair, ﬂoral shirt, baggy shorts and sandals. A shorter man,
rounder with longer, darker hair and a dark beard and crooked nose, also in ﬂoral shirt
and slacks. A woman, or perhaps girl, with short, red, spiky hair and army-shop pants,
sleeveless top, running shoes without socks. A shiny stud protrudes from under her
lip. She has small round ear-rings.

</p><!--l. 9573--><p class="indent" >  A conversation begins; they calmly and pleasantly introduce themselves as
members of the UCSD University staﬀ. They have issues. Not so much a
confrontation as a tangent. Two hours pass without mobile interruption or wireless
agitation.
</p><!--l. 9578--><p class="indent" >  They are activists, trouble-makers: anti-this, no-to-that. Den has never really had
much time for No people. But they are charming and they are a refreshing diversion
from the sedative luxury of these past days. They began their ‘interest group&#x2019; in the
early 2000&#x2019;s when the San Diego power companies privatized and increased power
prices by three hundred and eighty percent over night. There was a popular uprising,
in which people refused to pay. They tell him that, coming from the U.K., he ought to
remember, since the same crooks bought the British power grid and increased prices
to ﬂeece the more docile British public. That was probably before Den was
interested in such things. They have been following corporate corruption every
since.
</p><!--l. 9590--><p class="indent" >  At ﬁrst, Den listens as if researching an adversary, looking into the face of the
unknown soldier on the opposite side of a war. Then transmogriﬁcation: a battery of
impulses resonating in his thoughts. Little needles, pin-pricks of reason, puncturing

assumptions and fraying loose ends in his consciousness.
</p><!--l. 9596--><p class="indent" >  They thank him for his interesting talk. First ﬂatter him to let down his
guard. Then they express their worries. Not too strongly. Don&#x2019;t want to sound
like lunatics. Then the pin-pricks begin. Working him over, grinding him
down.
</p><!--l. 9601--><p class="indent" >  They talk of history, of the beginnings of the free market economy. The Chicago
boys&#x2019; laissez-faire dream, which the Chilean Pinochet thrust upon feudal poverty in
South America, turning the country into a power house of short-lived productivity and
ending it with a new class of Those Who Haves and of Those Who Have Nots. A
Nobel prize in economics rests on this project, but failure is the penalty for such
hubris.
</p><!--l. 9609--><p class="indent" >  They talk about the erosion of civil liberties and fundamental rights in the free
market West. They remind him of <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Magna Carta</span>, which surely any Englishman would
understand. Den cannot remember much about it from school. They talk about the
separation of church and state, written into the American constitution, during a time of
greater eloquence and insight.
</p><!--l. 9615--><p class="indent" >  They talk about the Fear and Ignorance tactics of government, a strategy
to preserve the old style of leadership in which only the privileged classes
were educated and the workers simply did as they were told. They explain to
him how this is fundamentally at odds with the modern Knowledge-based
Society, where expertise lies with the workers, not their leaders. They tell
him about the use of the church to shackle people, through guilt, to a higher
authority.
</p><!--l. 9623--><p class="indent" >  They talk about the game and its role in this strategy. How it is playing below the
belt, attempting all the tricks in the book to tip the scales in favour of Western
Corporate Multi-nationals, essentially the U.S. oligarchs. A new arena for persuasion.
with possibilities which he himself is developing.
</p><!--l. 9629--><p class="indent" >  Then they tell him about the alternatives. More Nobel prizes: forget the Milton
Friedmans; remember the Armtaya Sens and humane development, the role of social
conscience. Forget the Bible Belt power-mongers and return to a time of
enlightenment.
</p><!--l. 9634--><p class="indent" >  Den feels a smile growing inside him. He likes these people, but they fulﬁl his best
stereotypes of academics, lost in a dream of nineteen sixties nostalgia. Free love.
Make peace not war. Was there ever a serious side to all that?
</p><!--l. 9639--><p class="indent" >  He cannot deny their facts. The television channels are heavily populated by
political bias and Evangelical religious broadcasting. Some people would say that
both they and he work in the business of public brainwashing. He has never quite been
able to swallow these Americanized mass religious gatherings though. They remind
him too much of pictures of Nazi Germany, with Hitler standing in front of the
German rallies. The main diﬀerence is the badly artiﬁcial Evangelical sun-tans, and
hair-pieces that could have been stuck on from a poor photograph, cut out of a
seventies mail-order catalogue. They are easily recognizable by their vapid smiles and
their anti-abortionist badges, stuck onto expensive suits, paid for by the brainwashed

addicts who listen to them. His bitterness towards them surprises even him;
he has never lived here, but he has seen the tendrils spread to the U.K. and
Europe.
</p><!--l. 9654--><p class="indent" >  The politics of this are the essence of it. There is nothing spiritual going on here, he
thinks. They are right. It is pure indoctrination. And he knows that it is has been a
comfortable power-base for the Republicans, since the nineteen-eighties.
Bush had won eighty-one percent of the evangelical vote. He didn&#x2019;t need the

dying.
</p><!--l. 9661--><p class="indent" >  “Please, Den,” they say. “Don&#x2019;t be dazzled by King John or the Pope. If this game is
about bringing people together and giving people a voice, then great. But
if it is just a cover story for more corporate corruption, a way of locking
down the last public soap-box, it needs to be stopped. You ever been to Hyde

could not muster the computing power to analyze every meeting in the entire
game. In other words, they need us to come up with a server-side compromise
that gives the U.S. government the power of escrow on the anonymity of
players.”

</p><!--l. 9703--><p class="indent" >  She sat up beside him, pulling him onto his side in a playful mood. “By joining
together we could build a kind of net-wide telescope. A SETI program for the
game. The search for hostile life <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">out there</span>.” Then she took his middle ﬁnger
in her hand. and placed it on the inside of her knee. “When we detect an
alert situation, they then want us to be able to trace. . .” she drags his ﬁnger
from her knee “. . .the participants. . .” up her thigh “. . .through the net.” to
the place between her legs “to the source. And inﬁltrate deep to ﬁnd their
prize.”
</p><!--l. 9714--><p class="indent" >  He pauses for breath as he recalls.
</p><!--l. 9716--><p class="indent" >  It has become increasingly clear to Den that her little favour was more of a personal
matter than anything to do with her job. Cathy Kim is looking for her future
in all this, just as he is. She could manage without him, if she were only
interested in research, so there must be more to it than that. He can&#x2019;t fault her for
wanting more. Maybe there is a journey they can make together. It seems
like an opportunity to be taken seriously, as long as he does not become too
distracted from his main goals. This trip is not turning out exactly as he planned
it.
</p><!--l. 9726--><p class="indent" >  This is uncertain ground, he thinks. What am I getting myself into? He continues up
the path.
</p><!--l. 9729--><p class="indent" >  Den&#x2019;s mobile ﬁnds Kim in the gym. It is a large light room with large windows
looking out onto a grassy area. The room has an unpleasant tang of sweat and rubber
and leather ﬁttings. She is standing in front of a huge wall-covering mirror, lifting
small weights and admiring the slight but muscular ﬁgure he was admiring only hours
before.
</p><!--l. 9735--><p class="indent" >  He smiles at her. “I&#x2019;ve always wondered,” he says, “how the mirror helps.”
</p><!--l. 9737--><p class="indent" >  “Power of reﬂection. I&#x2019;m almost done.”
</p><!--l. 9739--><p class="indent" >  She pumps the weights with a discipline that Den admires. She is not distracted. He
likes that. She could almost have been made for him.
</p><!--l. 9742--><p class="indent" >  “I had a visit this morning.”
</p><!--l. 9744--><p class="indent" >  “Uh huh?”
</p><!--l. 9746--><p class="indent" >  “From some of the protesters, we have been hearing about in the news.”
</p><!--l. 9748--><p class="indent" >  “What? Are you okay?”
</p><!--l. 9750--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, yes. Nothing like that. They were very charming actually.”
</p><!--l. 9752--><p class="indent" >  “Really. . .”
</p><!--l. 9754--><p class="indent" >  “They seemed to have the whole thing ﬁgured out.”
</p><!--l. 9756--><p class="indent" >  “And what did they want from you?”
</p><!--l. 9758--><p class="indent" >  “Understanding mainly. And I think they see me as being able to prevent some
kind of misuse of the game. I really don&#x2019;t know why you all think I am so
important.”
</p><!--l. 9762--><p class="indent" >  She stops her pumping and walks over to him, her skin shiny with sweat..
</p><!--l. 9764--><p class="indent" >  “Thing about value is that you are just as valuable as people think you are. It&#x2019;s a
self-fulﬁlling prophesy. It doesn&#x2019;t matter how it started. It&#x2019;s what becomes of it that
matters.”

</p><!--l. 9768--><p class="indent" >  Of course, he knows about this eﬀect in marketing. Drop a grain of salt into a
saturated solution and it will make a big diamond-like crystal. So, deal with it. Feel
like a diamond, Den.
</p><!--l. 9772--><p class="indent" >  “No one at the brunch seemed to be that bothered about the news breaking like
this.”
</p><!--l. 9775--><p class="indent" >  “Of course not. They do not mind these diversions. It helps to keep the conspiracy
theories alive. They throw a cloud of uncertainty and doubt over their real
motives.”
</p><!--l. 9779--><p class="indent" >  “Money.”
</p><!--l. 9781--><p class="indent" >  She smiles. “It&#x2019;s that simple. Of course there is more at stake, but I don&#x2019;t think
government really believes it at this stage.”
</p><!--l. 9784--><p class="indent" >  “Government can do whatever it pleases here. The channels of corruption run deep.
People have been passive for too long.”
</p><!--l. 9788--><p class="indent" >  “You know, I meant to tell you that I also found a rogue billboard.”
</p><!--l. 9790--><p class="indent" >  “You did.”
</p><!--l. 9792--><p class="indent" >  “In Dubai. The text was corrupted. It looked like a programming error.”
</p><!--l. 9794--><p class="indent" >  “Ok, maybe we can go look at it later.”
</p><!--l. 9796--><p class="indent" >  “I sent in a bug report. I&#x2019;m hoping to get some analysis back from Malaysia”
</p><!--l. 9798--><p class="indent" >  “All right, never mind that, handsome. We should ﬁnd out about this senator friend
of yours.”
</p><!--l. 9801--><p class="indent" >  He groans on the inside. She wheedled it out of him while straddled across him, just
out of reach, last night. The General was right. Buttons and zippers are no
protection.
</p><!--l. 9805--><p class="indent" >  “I thought you wanted to look at the data to help law enforcement?”
</p><!--l. 9807--><p class="indent" >  “Maybe it&#x2019;s the same thing. If we are going to get in on this deal, we&#x2019;ll need some
leverage. Something tells me that your senator friend is not a hundred percent
legit.”
</p><!--l. 9811--><p class="indent" >  “In that case we&#x2019;ll need a creative advantage.”
</p><!--l. 9813--><p class="indent" >  “Well I suppose I could sleep with him,” she winks.
</p><!--l. 9815--><p class="indent" >  Den experiences a momentary ﬂash of something. Jealousy? No. He wipes out the
thought. Possessiveness is not a quality that he can aﬀord if he wants to ascend in the
ranks.
</p><!--l. 9819--><p class="indent" >  “What do you think he knows?”
</p><!--l. 9821--><p class="indent" >  “I think he is just an envoi.”
</p><!--l. 9823--><p class="indent" >  “So who has the real power?”
</p><!--l. 9825--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s the funny thing,” she says. “I am not sure that anyone does. This is
one of those self-sustaining conspiracies. Everyone believes in each other
because everyone believes in each other. That is the nature of celebrity. You
know, like the boy who lifted himself by his bootstraps. There&#x2019;s no centre of
power.”
</p><!--l. 9831--><p class="indent" >  “So how do you inﬁltrate an organization that has no centre?”
</p><!--l. 9833--><p class="indent" >  She hums.

</p><!--l. 9835--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I suppose you could try to create a centre. Make a splash that gets you
noticed. Then let the ripples spread. You have already done that.”
</p><!--l. 9839--><p class="indent" >  “So the trick is in keeping their attention until they remember you – and treat you as
a player. . .”
</p><!--l. 9842--><p class="indent" >  She winks. “Networking, Den. Networking.”

</p><!--l. 9892--><p class="indent" >  Jonas watches the drunken man bossing his wife and sighs on the inside. That man
might think he is in control, but one day the elastic will be stretched to its limit and
she will snap back at him with a killing force. For now the power trip of a bottle of
liquor will sustain the illusion of his dominance.
</p><!--l. 9898--><p class="indent" >  The incident brings back a suppressed unease. These domestic altercations have
been a constant companion to him too. He is no innocent.
</p><!--l. 9902--><p class="indent" >  Others in the bar are starting to stare and predictably a bouncer is making his way
through the crowded bar to eject the pair into the outside world where they will be
able to continue the abuse in the privacy of Oslo&#x2019;s mind-your-business streets. A
young girl, out for a drink with her friends, watches with a look of horror at the pair,
as though this were somehow not a common sight for this day and age. Charming that
she can retain the innocence of a sheltered upbringing, but it won&#x2019;t last long, not here
in the city.
</p><!--l. 9925--><p class="indent" >  Jonas is forty-ﬁve. He was a successful researcher, now head of the Norwegian
Research Council project group. Now he is sitting in the bar of his favourite haunt,
taking a surreptitious drink after work, and mulling over his precarious life. He has
agreed to meet Joe, his long time and close friend, who has been striving over an
application for something he feels is crucial to Norway&#x2019;s future. They never really
have time to talk these days. They have things to discuss, some papers to exchange.
Joe still likes paper.
</p><!--l. 9934--><p class="indent" >  They all come to discuss things with Jonas. For some reason his friends
see him a paragon of stability, a pillar of strength. Jonas hardly feels like
a Hercules or Goliath. Certainly his thinning hair is not the source of any
might.
</p><!--l. 9939--><p class="indent" >  Jonas Lindgren was hired by the council because he was considered to be an
eﬃcient and creative manager, with an talent for team building and getting things
done. At least, that&#x2019;s what they said at the time. That&#x2019;s what you get for being an
eco-scientist. He is also a doer.

</p><!--l. 9944--><p class="indent" >  He always was the one who sorted things out, even as a child. He is the strong silent
type, as they say: quiet but supportive. He would bolster his mother&#x2019;s doubts and resist
his father&#x2019;s belligerence. It is an attribute that people seem to value; they come to him
for advice and even just to be with him. He has often been told that he projects
a kind of calm that other&#x2019;s ﬁnd comforting, but he has never understood it
himself. No one who understood the turmoil that he suppresses could ever
say such a thing. Sometimes he feels like a priest. No, that was Joseph&#x2019;s
calling.
</p><!--l. 9954--><p class="indent" >  Jonas has had a few girlfriends, though none of them ever seemed to measure up to
that ﬁrst experience until Kaja. Women seemed two dimensional to him after
that ﬁrst experience and he kept them at arm&#x2019;s length. His wife, Kaja, was a
surprise. She was no facsimile of his earlier lovers, but she shared many of
the usual traits that he is unfortunately and fatefully attracted to. Perhaps it
is the control-freak discipline of his personality that draws him to women
that he absolutely cannot have any control over. Women with troubled or
diﬃcult demeanours seem to ﬂock to him and he falls for them again and
again.
</p><!--l. 9965--><p class="indent" >  Jonas eventually left his wife for seeing other men. She cared for him,
but more like a faithful dog than as a lover. So he bought a dog to keep him
company for a while. Then the dog left him. It ran oﬀ somewhere and was
never seen again. He imagines it dognapped and enslaved in an east European
brothel, or perhaps in the deep freeze of a Chinese restaurant. No. It isn&#x2019;t really
funny.
</p><!--l. 9981--><p class="indent" >  Jonas shakes himself out of his dreaming and sips at his beer. The little pub has a
nice bar with a high ceiling and huge pieces of art on the walls. He used
to come here with the rest of the crew of his little company, but bit by bit
he has stopped asking them and has come here to escape. It is important to
carve a place for oneself in this world of increasingly pervasive noise. If not a
silence then a freedom from the obligation to communicate. It is a restful
place but an odd place, he thinks, full of local people from every walk of
life. It has a good buzz—a background of white noise that, in spite of the
chatter, is so unspeciﬁc that it is restful. He often turns oﬀ his mobile when
he gets here or at least pretends not to notice if someone channels him a
message.
</p><!--l. 9994--><p class="indent" >  A tall black man in threadbare jeans and a scruﬀy sweater enters the bar
and edges his way towards him. Jonas&#x2019;s friend places a salutory hand on his
shoulder.
</p><!--l. 9998--><p class="indent" >  “Joseph! How are you?” he says turning to greet the tall ﬁgure, shaking his hand.
“I&#x2019;ve been saving you a place.” He moves a bag from the bar stool next to him. “What
are you having?”
</p><!--l. 10002--><p class="indent" >  “Good to see you. Jonas. You look tired though, man. They been workin&#x2019; you too
hard?”
</p><!--l. 10005--><p class="indent" >  “You read me like a book, sir.”

</p><!--l. 10007--><p class="indent" >  “Hah. What book? Not the Bible, for sure. Maybe a tabloid magazine or
something.” He laughs. “I&#x2019;ll have a light beer. It looks like I probably can&#x2019;t stay long.
I&#x2019;m on duty at the youth centre, last minute notice.” He hands Jonas a folder of papers.
“This is for you.”
</p><!--l. 10013--><p class="indent" >  Jonas smiles and gestures with his upturned hand to Joseph&#x2019;s clothing. “Ok. You
look diﬀerent. I don&#x2019;t think I have ever seen you in jeans before.”
</p><!--l. 10017--><p class="indent" >  Joseph laughs. “Do you like them? I have always wanted to own a pair of jeans.
Call it my treat to myself. I am in the mood for a little decadence.”
</p><!--l. 10021--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s very decadent.”
</p><!--l. 10023--><p class="indent" >  “A little symbol of western capitalism, manufactured in the heart of the communist
far east.”
</p><!--l. 10026--><p class="indent" >  Jonas gestures to the girl at the bar and gets him a beer.
</p><!--l. 10028--><p class="indent" >  “So you&#x2019;re still involved in the youth centre?”
</p><!--l. 10030--><p class="indent" >  Joseph nods. “Not as much as these last years. It&#x2019;s time for me to move on, but yes,
I still play a part. Take watches. You know. It&#x2019;s good to be around the kids. It keeps
them away from the river.”
</p><!--l. 10034--><p class="indent" >  “You mean away from drugs?”
</p><!--l. 10036--><p class="indent" >  “Right.”
</p><!--l. 10038--><p class="indent" >  Jonas shifts his eyebrows. “I&#x2019;d almost forgotten about that kind of thing. You know
I live such a isolated existence these days. I can&#x2019;t remember the last time I actually
walked along the river, or was oﬀered dope.” He smiles. “I should get out
more.”
</p><!--l. 10043--><p class="indent" >  “Good to hear you say that,” his friend chimes. “You might not realize it, but other
people have things call lives. If you don&#x2019;t have one you&#x2019;re missing out.” He laughs and
pats Jonas on the arm amicably. “So anyway, what do you think?” He gestures to his
jeans.
</p><!--l. 10049--><p class="indent" >  Jonas smiles quizzically. “I like it. A new style. What came over you?”
</p><!--l. 10051--><p class="indent" >  “You mean apart from a little extra money? Ah. . .here we are. . .” His beer arrives
and he pulls it from the bar and says, “Skål Jonas!”.
</p><!--l. 10055--><p class="indent" >  “Skål!”, Jonas chimes, lifting his glass, and they drink to their meeting.
</p><!--l. 10057--><p class="indent" >  “Ah that&#x2019;s good, man,” Joe says appreciatively. “Lots of things have been coming
over me lately. I have been thinking a lot about our project with the schools, talking to
the other countries participatin&#x2019;. You know. It&#x2019;s good.”
</p><!--l. 10062--><p class="indent" >  “Good?”
</p><!--l. 10064--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s good to get out for me too. I&#x2019;ve been doing more of it lately. Should have
started a long time ago.”
</p><!--l. 10067--><p class="indent" >  Jonas&#x2019;s eyes narrow with curiosity. It seems like an unusual thing for his friend to
say. Joseph has been becoming a de facto priest for the Catholic church for as
long as he can remember. Indeed, Jonas&#x2019;s scepticism for all kinds of religion
was what made them friends to begin with. That and the similarity in their
names.
</p><!--l. 10073--><p class="indent" >  “Looking for a change?”
</p><!--l. 10075--><p class="indent" >  “Of course. Things have to change.”

</p><!--l. 10077--><p class="indent" >  “Change is healthy.”
</p><!--l. 10079--><p class="indent" >  “Change is the world at work, my friend. Everything changes: seasons,
birds, bees, morals, hairstyles. . .” He smiles. “You have to let things grow.
You let the young plant the seeds and then you trust that the universe will
unfold as it should. But we older ones can take a while to reﬂect on what is
important.”
</p><!--l. 10085--><p class="indent" >  “What is that?” Jonas says jokingly. “Tell me, I really wish I knew.”
</p><!--l. 10087--><p class="indent" >  “A pair of jeans perhaps?”
</p><!--l. 10089--><p class="indent" >  They laugh.
</p><!--l. 10092--><p class="indent" >  “Seriously, Jonas. I am looking forward to the new project. I think I can do more
there. I am tired of ﬁghting ﬁres in these youth centres. I want to go to the source.” He
taps the folder of papers.
</p><!--l. 10097--><p class="indent" >  Jonas conceals his surprise with no more than a wrinkle of an eyebrow. This is not
the Joe he knew in college. That one had learned that you just don&#x2019;t ask too
many questions and you follow the so-called Good Book, or its hypocritical
soothsayers.
</p><!--l. 10102--><p class="indent" >  “I thought you were happy doing what you were doing.”
</p><!--l. 10104--><p class="indent" >  “Mmmm,” he sounds, gulping at his beer. “Well.”
</p><!--l. 10106--><p class="indent" >  Jonas snorts, waiting for his completion. This is typical of Joe to say something
provocative.
</p><!--l. 10109--><p class="indent" >  “You can reach – well, let&#x2019;s say, a dicey plateau of contentment, or you can
achieve blissful oblivion or denial. No, man. No sense in trying to hide from the
truth.”
</p><!--l. 10113--><p class="indent" >  “Joe the heretic!”.
</p><!--l. 10115--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m quoting you, Jonas!”
</p><!--l. 10117--><p class="indent" >  “Oh.” He grins.
</p><!--l. 10119--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s a random walk. Open ourselves up to the truth of our suﬀering. It&#x2019;s what life is
about. The struggle. It&#x2019;s not the arriving, but the getting there.”
</p><!--l. 10123--><p class="indent" >  Jonas grunts.
</p><!--l. 10125--><p class="indent" >  “You know it, Jonas. I think you have always understood it. But it has taken me
longer to see that you were right.”
</p><!--l. 10128--><p class="indent" >  This is a new Joe, for certain.
</p><!--l. 10130--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Quoting me at me? Did I make such an impression?</span>
</p><!--l. 10141--><p class="indent" >  “Religion&#x2019;s just an outmoded form of politics, anyway”, Jonas would grumble. ”A
way of using fear to control people because you don&#x2019;t have a decent system of law and
order. How easy to preach true morality and have it enforced on penalty of an eternity
of suﬀering.”
</p><!--l. 10148--><p class="indent" >  Joe laughed, “You know what they are calling the Christians now? Ringbearers.
You know the rings they wear now to show that they are saving their virtue for
marriage?”
</p><!--l. 10164--><p class="indent" >  “All right. Actually, I heard that there was a development in the project, a sudden
interest from the Americans? I haven&#x2019;t really had time to follow things. I have been
busy with the Fulbright stuﬀ. It was one of the contacts there that leaked it to

me.”
</p><!--l. 10169--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s right. You wouldn&#x2019;t have thought it would you? I guess they are
coming around to the idea that this is the only way that they are going to
ﬁght crime in the long term. Scrub ‘zero tolerance&#x2019;, this is deeper again.
Trouble is, they want to own it. But they want to buy us out. I&#x2019;m not sure about
it.”
</p><!--l. 10175--><p class="indent" >  It seems like a ﬂash of good news to him, but his alarm bells are ringing. The noble
initiative was a Norwegian idea, from the Peace Institute, but that is no guarantee that
it would catch on elsewhere. Every country is the same though: rising petty crime,
drug abuse, anti-social tendencies. That was why he pushed the funding of this
project. There is no respect for the power of education anymore, except perhaps
amongst a rich elite who already have one. People want everything on the cheap
now.
</p><!--l. 10184--><p class="indent" >  So why not perform a little attitude adjustment directly at lower school level, teach
kids manners and consideration again, like they used to?
</p><!--l. 10188--><p class="indent" >  “Is the interest corporate or governmental?” he asks. “Or is it Ringbearers?”
</p><!--l. 10191--><p class="indent" >  Joseph smile. “What&#x2019;s the diﬀerence?”
</p><!--l. 10193--><p class="indent" >  “Government can have some controls. If companies are involved, they will use this
as an opportunity for targeted advertising. If the church is involved, they could use it
for indoctrination.”
</p><!--l. 10199--><p class="indent" >  “Church is already involved, Jonas. Well, we&#x2019;ve made mistakes in the past. That&#x2019;s a
long story. Innocent mistakes.”
</p><!--l. 10202--><p class="indent" >  “Innocence.” He whistles playfully.
</p><!--l. 10204--><p class="indent" >  He shrugs and swallows some ale.
</p><!--l. 10206--><p class="indent" >  Jonas recalls the incident. Businesses saw it as an opportunity to use market forces
to change minds about basic attitudes. But, they also wanted to proﬁt from the results,
so marketing departments dreamt up campaigns that would make the company look
good and altruistic. Unfortunately, the marketeers were not that savvy; the cogs
turned, and before they knew what had happened, the thing had taken on a mind of its
own. They were churning out corporate advertising, trying to sell their products to
kids, rather than trying to teach them basic manners. They sort of lost the
reins.
</p><!--l. 10216--><p class="indent" >  “Well. Par for the course. Yee-hah, Doctor Frankenstein. Anyway, I think it&#x2019;s great.
The project has gained some international support now. The French have shown
interest in it. It seems that governments are ﬁnally understanding the need for
education for everyone. There is also growing interest in Asia and the far
East.”
</p><!--l. 10222--><p class="indent" >  “All true. It might actually make a diﬀerence. So, did you see our write-up in the
paper? They speak well of our achievements here in Oslo.”
</p><!--l. 10226--><p class="indent" >  “No, which paper?”
</p><!--l. 10228--><p class="indent" >  “Le Monde.”
</p><!--l. 10230--><p class="indent" >  “Not my grazing grounds, I&#x2019;m afraid.”
</p><!--l. 10232--><p class="indent" >  “I heard that the custodians of the oil fund were pressured by the industrialized

nations to put the project into action.”
</p><!--l. 10235--><p class="indent" >  “What do you mean?”
</p><!--l. 10237--><p class="indent" >  “I mean the government here. Someone had to come up with the money.”
</p><!--l. 10239--><p class="indent" >  “Well that was me,” Jonas quips. “Though it&#x2019;s true that we did get a bonus pot for
that project. I haven&#x2019;t heard anything about the reasons. I&#x2019;ve been a bit too tied up to
ﬁnd out.”
</p><!--l. 10243--><p class="indent" >  Joe nods. “You look tired, Jonas.”
</p><!--l. 10245--><p class="indent" >  “No kidding.”
</p><!--l. 10247--><p class="indent" >  “What&#x2019;s up? Something with Kaja?”
</p><!--l. 10249--><p class="indent" >  Jonas takes the name like a shot across his bow. He does not want to enter into a
discussion about his private life just now. Joseph will delve if he is given
the chance. He ﬂounders slightly and steers the conversation back. “You
know, I was talking to this kid the other day. He has just started a masters at
the University here. He actually told me that he felt school was a waste of
time.”
</p><!--l. 10256--><p class="indent" >  “Is this so unusual? I mean kids say that all the time, right?”
</p><!--l. 10258--><p class="indent" >  “Well, more than that. He said that no one had ever demanded anything of him –
never stretched him – not even once throughout his entire career. Don&#x2019;t you think it is
a little scary?”
</p><!--l. 10262--><p class="indent" >  “You are asking someone from Africa about how scary a lack of education
is?”
</p><!--l. 10264--><p class="indent" >  “I think someone predicted something like this in about 2000. I mean,
that the world has been getting dumber for some time. They claimed that it
is part of the convenience society. There was some research done. I forget
where. In the end we are so lazy that we are helpless. It&#x2019;s one of the Doomsday
scenarios.”
</p><!--l. 10270--><p class="indent" >  Joseph raised his glass. “And the great wheel keeps on turning. I think that&#x2019;s a cue
for a drink. Here&#x2019;s to our programme!”
</p><!--l. 10273--><p class="indent" >  They drink.
</p><!--l. 10275--><p class="indent" >  “By the way,” Jonas recalls. “Do you remember a Professor Egeland? He taught
some of the early science courses?”
</p><!--l. 10278--><p class="indent" >  “Uh huh.”
</p><!--l. 10280--><p class="indent" >  “He just quit the university after thirty years to become a writer.”
</p><!--l. 10282--><p class="indent" >  “Good for him.”
</p><!--l. 10284--><p class="indent" >  “No, he is very bitter about it. Disillusioned by the Department of Education and its
budget-rent-a-prof attitude to education. He told me that there is no sense in banging
your head against the wall, when all they want is cheap feel-good recipes that they can
follow without question.”
</p><!--l. 10291--><p class="indent" >  “I. . .”
</p><!--l. 10293--><p class="indent" >  “Jonas Lindgren! Is that you?!” Something punches him amicably on the arm. A
short stocky man with a fat face appears beside him, closer than Jonas would prefer.
“Leif Erik Larsen. We met at the conference on ecological development last
April?”

</p><!--l. 10298--><p class="indent" >  Jonas glances helplessly at Joseph. “How do you do.” He shakes his hand. “Do you
come here often?”
</p><!--l. 10301--><p class="indent" >  “No. not really. You know I have been trying to contact you for several days. You
are a hard man to reach.”
</p><!--l. 10304--><p class="indent" >  “Uh, yes. I am very busy.” With everything except my job, he thinks.
</p><!--l. 10306--><p class="indent" >  “Well, this is a lucky coincidence. I don&#x2019;t mean to interrupt you gents.”
</p><!--l. 10309--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I . . .”
</p><!--l. 10311--><p class="indent" >  “I won&#x2019;t take up much of your time. This is important and I have been calling your
number for a while.”
</p><!--l. 10314--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m not very well prepared. It might be better if you called me tomorrow.”
</p><!--l. 10316--><p class="indent" >  “Oh this won&#x2019;t take a moment.”
</p><!--l. 10318--><p class="indent" >  Jonas squirms, looking to Joe for backup, but he is looking restless.
</p><!--l. 10320--><p class="indent" >  “Look, I have to go, Jonas,” Joe says. “Let&#x2019;s do this again soon.”
</p><!--l. 10322--><p class="indent" >  “Eh . . . Joe. Look. Never mind. All right. Sorry about this.”
</p><!--l. 10324--><p class="indent" >  “No, really. I should go anyway.”
</p><!--l. 10326--><p class="indent" >  The man looks modestly apologetic. “Look, I don&#x2019;t mean to intrude or break
anything up here. . .”
</p><!--l. 10329--><p class="indent" >  “I have to go anyway. Let me know what you think, Jonas.” He gestures to the
papers he brought.
</p><!--l. 10332--><p class="indent" >  Joseph leaves.
</p><!--l. 10334--><p class="indent" >  “So Mr. Lindgren, you might remember, I am from the ministry of foreign aﬀairs.
You know that we&#x2019;ve been studying the famine in Eastern Africa. We are hoping that
you will fund a study that will help our budget commitment to the famine
relief.”
</p><!--l. 10339--><p class="indent" >  Jonas frowns. “Well, you know the budget has been ﬁnalized now and the funding
assignments have pretty much already been decided.”
</p><!--l. 10342--><p class="indent" >  “Well, we are hoping that you will make an exception in this crisis.”
</p><!--l. 10345--><p class="indent" >  It is true, he knows: this is the ﬁrst major famine in years. The newspapers have
been oﬀering their usual stew of inﬂamed hearsay, hammered to the point of a double
edged sword. Pleading eyes and desperate faces, chosen with editorial care, adorn the
covers of newspapers and magazines to maximize the world&#x2019;s guilt for allowing this
natural disaster to occur.
</p><!--l. 10352--><p class="indent" >  “Other nations are making statements of support, and long term commitments to
address the climate issues. We feel we should do the same.”
</p><!--l. 10355--><p class="indent" >  “But surely that is not a matter for a research council?”
</p><!--l. 10357--><p class="indent" >  “The ministry feels it is: it would send a good signal to be seen to be investing in
long term solutions, rather than just direct aid. You can&#x2019;t just put a plaster on the
future!”
</p><!--l. 10361--><p class="indent" >  Nice slogan, but guilt is not an emotion that Jonas has ever felt compelled to
exhibit. The eyes of Europe are on this disaster and the cries for help and being
answered with nominal budget reallocations.
</p><!--l. 10366--><p class="indent" >  “I think my job is to fund progress not famine relief.”

</p><!--l. 10368--><p class="indent" >  This pipsqueak civil servant is asking him to give up his hard won pittance for
research to cover another budget with more political feel-good ﬂoss? The sums of
money he has at his disposition are hardly signiﬁcant for something like
this.
</p><!--l. 10373--><p class="indent" >  “But you know what they say – no more than four meals from anarchy.”
</p><!--l. 10375--><p class="indent" >  “Or four extra meals to libertarianism.”
</p><!--l. 10377--><p class="indent" >  He sends him an uncomprehending stare.
</p><!--l. 10379--><p class="indent" >  “I feel conﬁdent that we can work out an arrangement. This will mean a lot to
Norway&#x2019;s image as a global player. It will make us practically an economic
superpower, compared to other countries.”
</p><!--l. 10383--><p class="indent" >  Jonas hides his reaction by emptying his glass of beer.
</p><!--l. 10385--><p class="indent" >  “So I&#x2019;ll come by at the end of the week to make the arrangements then.” It was not
a question.
</p><!--l. 10388--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I am going to be pretty busy with the details of the collaborative research
conference. And the Research Open Day is coming up with the Colleges and
Universities.”
</p><!--l. 10392--><p class="indent" >  “We have an obligation to help. I know you&#x2019;ll come around.”
</p><!--l. 10394--><p class="indent" >  Something in his tone tells Jonas that the matter has already been decided. Now he
will leave and everything will be as he has implied. Jonas feels the relief of a
drowning man who knows that it is time to accept his fate.
</p><!--l. 10399--><p class="indent" >  “I suppose we can look at the budgets again.”
</p><!--l. 10401--><p class="indent" >  Why couldn&#x2019;t Joe have stayed put? Christ. He came here to get away from it all.
Oslo is too small, he thinks.
</p><!--l. 10404--><p class="indent" >  What is the point of a pub if you can&#x2019;t escape from your day job? And how do you
get away from the ball and chain that hangs on your wrist? People can&#x2019;t blow smoke
in each others&#x2019; faces anymore, but at least they can zone out and pretend to be talking
to someone else if they don&#x2019;t like their company. We&#x2019;re all sitting here not sure
whether we want to meet each other or hide from each other. Everyone has their own
story.
</p><!--l. 10412--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">So what is mine?</span>
</p><!--l. 10414--><p class="indent" >  And look at the loser on the end of the long bar. Who is that sad old fuck? He sits in
the bar every night and never says a word, drinking his beer, all by himself. Then he
staggers home drunk to whatever awaits him. Is it an unhappy home? Or maybe no
home at all?
</p>

</p><!--l. 10420--><p class="noindent" >*</p></div>
<!--l. 10423--><p class="indent" >  Jonas feels a rhythmical pulsing in the arm of his sweater. Obviously he forgot to
switch oﬀ his mobile today. He is using his bracelet watch today as his organizer. He
glances brieﬂy at it. It&#x2019;s ﬂashing him an E-mail. He ought to ignore it but, like most

people, he can&#x2019;t quite free himself from its charms. There is a message from John, the
English intern at the oﬃce. They talked about going to the gym together, but Jonas
feigned other plans.
</p><!--l. 10443--><p class="indent" >  He leaves the bar and steps out into the wintery darkness. The time is about 20:00,
but you can never quite tell in January. With only a few hours of daylight, and the
cloud-cover to provide a roof for the city&#x2019;s electrical lighting, it is diﬃcult to tell one
time from another. He trudges up the narrow street looking as he always does at
the buildings along the way: no two of them alike, a variety of architectural
styles from the last century that pepper Oslo with the good the bad and the
ugly. Cars are parked at every place of both sides of the road of this back
street. He squeezes through a gap, climbing over the mound of cleared snow
to cross the street where he can get oﬀ the more populated main street of
Grünerløkka.
</p><!--l. 10455--><p class="indent" >  Jonas pauses. Snow is falling as he trudges methodically up the slight incline by the
old brewery. It is much milder suddenly and the calm that only accompanies falling
snow seems to envelop the street. A slight rumble glides past him—a car. He stops to
admire its grace in this quiet street. How paradoxical that the archetypal opposite of
nature, the car, could move so silently through it, almost respectfully sliding
through the ﬂakes with only the slightest crackle from the studded tires. It is a
beautiful sight. A silver bullet moving in slow motion through nature&#x2019;s song of
peace.
</p><!--l. 10466--><p class="indent" >  He continues his meager climb up to the top of the hill, glancing down at the
waterfall as he walks on by. It has frozen over in the last day or two. The weather
is getting stranger by the year, it seems. Warm. Cold. Warm. Cold. Snow.
Rain. Sun. Gone are the days when one knew roughly when winter would
start.
</p><!--l. 10472--><p class="indent" >  Back in the 1950s, John Von Neumann dreamed that we would be able to control
the weather, using computers to make accurate predictions, but even he probably
realized that there was only a slim chance of being able to describe it accurately
enough. Managing it is something else altogether; for that you would need a machine
at least as complicated as nature itself, in which case it would just be a storm of its
own.
</p><!--l. 10479--><p class="indent" >  Jonas stops and looks around. Behind him, a few feet away, tree bark shatters into
dust, leaving a ﬂaky hole in the side of the old tree. At ﬁrst he looks away, not
realizing what has happened. Then, too incredulous to believe it, he simply stands and
stares.
</p><!--l. 10484--><p class="indent" >  His mobile rings. He taps the control on his watch. ”Hello?”
</p><!--l. 10487--><p class="indent" >  “Jonas, it&#x2019;s me. Can I come over?”
</p><!--l. 10489--><p class="indent" >  It&#x2019;s Kaja.
</p><!--l. 10491--><p class="indent" >  “Not really, I&#x2019;m not home.” He moves closer to the tree to look at the place where
the shot struck it.
</p><!--l. 10494--><p class="indent" >  “I need to talk to you,” she says. She sounds miserable, but that is normal; it does
not necessarily mean that she is. She is used to getting her way, by indulging her

emotions at any cost to those around her.
</p><!--l. 10499--><p class="indent" >  He sighs. “I&#x2019;ll call you when I get home,” he lies. “I&#x2019;m kind of busy right
now.”
</p><!--l. 10502--><p class="indent" >  He hangs up. The mobile rings again. Impatiently, “Yes?”
</p><!--l. 10505--><p class="indent" >  This time there is no voice, just a few moments of silence and the connection is
broken. His mobile signals that a ﬁle has been uploaded, but the information about the
ﬁle is empty. Then the mobile screen goes dark and starts the reboot.
</p><!--l. 10510--><p class="indent" >  “What the..?” For a moment there is a temptation to destroy the peaceful falling of
the snowﬂakes. It is a long time since his mobile actually crashed. But he is tired and
just stuﬀs the little device into his pocket.

</p><!--l. 10525--><p class="indent" >  They drive Preeta and her small suitcase, from the airport, to a spacious, if sterile,
ﬂat near the busy centre of an autumnal Oslo. They tell her that it is close to the
central police headquarters and to shops and services—to where she will be
working. It is close to Little Asia, to familiar food and familiar, cosmopolitan
diversity.
</p><!--l. 10532--><p class="indent" >  They deposit her in a room. The room is warm and dry as a bone. There is
something cardboard about it. It is too perfect, too new, too dry, too lifeless. She is in a
foreign land. She feels this now, outside the familiar cocoon of Asia. It is almost as
though she never left the airport. It has a more immediate sense of dislocation
than the VR. She cannot deny its reality, nor adjust its parameters. She is
powerless.
</p><!--l. 10539--><p class="indent" >  They give her a key and a new mobile and tell her not to use the old one, because
you never know what someone might have done to such an accessible electronic
collar. These days, it is so easy to be followed and traced to source. You don&#x2019;t want
your enemies to be able to track you down without even lifting a ﬁnger; you don&#x2019;t
want to ﬂy a ﬂag to show them how to ﬁnd you.
</p><!--l. 10546--><p class="indent" >  She is now a ﬂoating soul, serving time in a purgatory of greedy gods: gods who are
bartering for the bounty of her. The criss-cross lines of planetary cause and eﬀect have
intertwined and woven their skein into a noose to hang her by. She must be so careful,
so careful. This egg-shell trail is not leading to any Wizard of Oz. No one, at its end is
going to ﬁx her wooden heart.
</p><!--l. 10553--><p class="indent" >  They tell her to that she can feel safe here. She will be looked-after, and her mobile
has a panic-button that she can press for emergency assistance. In a world of
transnational power-play, you never quite know where you are, or whom you might
trust. But you know who your friends are, don&#x2019;t you; I mean, you trust us, right? We
already met in our own Virtual Paradise. We wandered into that place of our own
making, that we agreed on, at the same time and place. We made contact with
tentative feelers and suggestive expressions, gradually building the conﬁdence to talk

about our common interests and fears. Isn&#x2019;t that proof enough that we are
soul-mates? That we needed each other? That we have something to oﬀer one
another?
</p><!--l. 10565--><p class="indent" >  They tell her that she will be working with Interpol and that her knowledge is
valuable to many people: too valuable for her to remain in Asia, in the hands of the
federated maﬁa. She wants to know if she can contact people back in Kuala Lumpur.
She is worried about them, if they will be all right. They say that it would
not be a good idea. It is a dangerous time, a time to keep one&#x2019;s head down
and to survive. No one is certain of whom they can trust, or who is pulling
the strings. They tell her that governments are involved, that the forces of
international law and order are now ﬁghting for their own independence against
the very governments that command them. Who is actually commanding
whom?

<!--l. 10581--><p class="indent" >  Questions and more questions; speech transformed into a more material presence,
from the whispers of virtual chatter. Conversation reveals odorous humans, not
pristine simulations, lurking behind diﬀerent skins.
</p><!--l. 10586--><p class="indent" >  She has arrived in a place that she was never expecting to visit; it seems to greet her
with an incommensurate enthusiasm. Should she be pleased or disturbed? Come into
our parlour. . .
</p><!--l. 10590--><p class="indent" >  At ﬁrst it is frightening, in spite of her resolve to show no fear. She still feels
the presence of crumpled paper between her legs, the scrapes and bruises
of physical mishandling. She balks at the immediacy of this interrogatory
welcome.
</p><!--l. 10595--><p class="indent" >  “I cannot talk like this,” she says, as Bishop tries to communicate. “It&#x2019;s too . .
.”
</p><!--l. 10598--><p class="indent" >  Too much, too soon.
</p><!--l. 10600--><p class="indent" >  Bishop nods.
</p><!--l. 10602--><p class="indent" >  “Let&#x2019;s meet in the VR.”
</p><!--l. 10604--><p class="indent" >  “I understand,” he says. ”We&#x2019;ll do that. Meet me here.” He ﬂashes her an address.
She receives it on her new arm bracelet.
</p><!--l. 10608--><p class="indent" >  Thus they go, each to their separate, over-dry rooms; they don their mobile
accessories and they enter the game, each at their own locations, and seek one another
out, as they have done many times before. Dial up the directory of places and times, of
levels and scores and select a small, private test program, The developers have set this
aside for themselves, for them to talk and discuss. This is not that place, but another
place like it.
</p><!--l. 10616--><p class="indent" >  Preeta checks out the address before simply walking into it. Trust is not easily won,

especially not hers. A lifetime of necessary caution has seen to that. Even if
she had not avoided physical intimidation by ﬂeeing half way across the
planet, her mind could still be at risk. They can still steal her freedom by
playing the game of the game: by subtle brainwashing, drawn out stealthily
over time. This is a new kind of attack and intimidation that is loose in the
world.
</p><!--l. 10624--><p class="indent" >  She takes the plunge into the half-world of the game. The meeting place they have
chosen is a chat room rather than an action board. It presents a futuristic oﬃce
block, with furniture in the form of twentieth century computer-hardware
components.
</p><!--l. 10629--><p class="indent" >  She materializes slowly, as is the custom in busy areas of the game. It
is like walking around a gigantic printed circuit board,: resistor sofas and
integrated circuit tables. This is the game developers&#x2019; idea of a fun place to
work.
</p><!--l. 10634--><p class="indent" >  The ghosted images of other avatars occupy the space, moving around as they
would have in the game developers&#x2019; real workplace. She uses a private channel as they
always did, so the other shapes remain mere shadows of people. The others are simply
there for company, for the magic of it.
</p><!--l. 10640--><p class="indent" >  Although this is not their usual meeting place, it is an adequate facsimile of it. She
should not show herself in that original for the time being, just in case someone is
monitoring the area. Someone from the inside. The authenticity of it shows that
Bishop knows of the place where she and her contact have been meeting and talking.
She has not described, to anyone else, which of the many places the developers have
at their disposal for discussing the development of the game. It is a conﬁdence
building gesture.
</p><!--l. 10649--><p class="indent" >  Preeta draws conﬁdence from the familiar shapes; she feels now that she is talking
to someone with privileged knowledge of the consortium resources, if nothing else.
She has not been lured into an obvious trap. If this is a deception, then these people
are very clever.
</p><!--l. 10654--><p class="indent" >  “You should not use the old identity any more, just in case someone is monitoring
us. Someone who shouldn&#x2019;t be,” Bishop told her.
</p><!--l. 10657--><p class="indent" >  “Just once,” she replied. “Just one more time, to ﬁnd out how my colleagues are
getting on at home.” When they ﬁnd that she is gone, someone else will surely be a
new target. She should try to lure them away, to protect her co-workers.
</p><!--l. 10662--><p class="indent" >  “We&#x2019;ll talk about that later,” he says. “Not now.” It is tempting to simply break
away now, to seek out her colleagues. She resists.
</p><!--l. 10665--><p class="indent" >  She has come here because it seems to be far away from the arm-twisting
intimidation of the Russian mobsters and their Asian side-kicks. Here she has a
possible future, one that is closer than she could have imagined to her dream of
a life of freedom. The aim? To get through this introduction and ﬁnd her
feet.
</p><!--l. 10671--><p class="indent" >  So close to something so coveted, she responds to the sudden impatience to
reach for the previously unattainable. Concentrate, Preeta. All the years of

studying, on your own, will pay oﬀ, if you only concentrate and do your
job.
</p><!--l. 10676--><p class="indent" >  They greet each other as they always have done in the VR.
</p><!--l. 10678--><p class="indent" >  “Are you still there?” she asks.
</p><!--l. 10680--><p class="indent" >  “Where secrets were kept and people wept,” he replies.
</p><!--l. 10682--><p class="indent" >  What an oddly contrived thing to say, but why should she care? That is it. She is in
the hands of the right people. If she has been tricked, it is a far more elaborate ploy
than a simple hijack in the back of a van.
</p><!--l. 10687--><p class="indent" >  They talk about the game and about her work, about how the diagnostic traces that
their software in Kuala Lumpur has been able to perform have seen a pattern of
behaviour in the game, the same pattern that she has been following for some time, the
same pattern that they have been discussing.
</p><!--l. 10693--><p class="indent" >  “I thought that you were on the inside as a developer,” she tells him.
</p><!--l. 10695--><p class="indent" >  “In a sense, we are. You have been talking to our team, not just to one
person.”
</p><!--l. 10698--><p class="indent" >  “I thought so. You have a whole team working on this.”
</p><!--l. 10700--><p class="indent" >  Bishop&#x2019;s VR representation nods. “Here in Norway, we&#x2019;re required to investigate
any software that is as pervasive as this gaming software is. If any software company
wants to sell its game services in Norway, they have to accept our laws and
procedures. Society is still quite tightly regulated here. It is one of the advantages we
have in this investigation. One of of the reasons why you are here and not in the
U.S..”
</p><!--l. 10708--><p class="indent" >  “But you have access to the code? Corporate secrets.”
</p><!--l. 10710--><p class="indent" >  “Yes. We have access because one of the game consortium&#x2019;s key partners is a big
gaming company that is based here in Oslo. As long as they are here and follow our
rules, we use the opportunity to use their expertise in analysing the game. The
consortium has to agree to it. This is an important market.
</p><!--l. 10716--><p class="indent" >  “Our contacts in Interpol apply pressure too, in the United States to make that
happen. This is really a huge investigation that was prompted by the F.B.I. themselves.
They have been watching the corruption of government for some time. So the
game consortium really doesn&#x2019;t have any choice about submitting to these
investigations.”
</p><!--l. 10722--><p class="indent" >  “But are they not trying to conceal the secret features? The bending content? In
Malaysia have all had to sign Non-Disclosure Agreements. They say that, if we reveal
any of the details of the subliminal content we will be prosecuted to the full extent of
the law. Which means the full extent of corruption.”
</p><!--l. 10728--><p class="indent" >  “It must be frightening.”
</p><!--l. 10730--><p class="indent" >  She nods.
</p><!--l. 10732--><p class="indent" >  “Have you never thought of getting out of this?”
</p><!--l. 10734--><p class="indent" >  She laughs. “All the time.”
</p><!--l. 10736--><p class="indent" >  “Well, perhaps we can help you. We have some funds for our core activities. That&#x2019;s
how we brought you here. It can&#x2019;t be all that diﬃcult to convince someone to give you
a long term job.”

</p><!--l. 10740--><p class="indent" >  They watch for a moment, observing the passing ghosts, banding together in
clusters. They are all here, in one place, but not really together: each group in their
bubble, their own private channel. So why do they need the illusion of seeing one
another, of pretending to be together when they simply cut each other out? Is it
security? Is it mandatory policy to prevent overlapping conversations? Are they
lonely? Do they know it?
</p><!--l. 10748--><p class="indent" >  “I thought I was doing the right thing. If western governments want to manipulate
their peoples I don&#x2019;t care. Our company needs to survive. We are used to this kind of
thing in our business. As long as it is bringing in earnings, then I am doing the right
thing. I mean, this kind of corruption or manipulation or whatever you want to call
it, it has been happening throughout history one way of the other, hasn&#x2019;t
it?”
</p><!--l. 10757--><p class="indent" >  “Yes it has.” Bishop says, impressed by her. “So you reported this problem to your
boss and he wasn&#x2019;t interested? Wouldn&#x2019;t that be a serious problem for your
company?”
</p><!--l. 10761--><p class="indent" >  She scowls. “My boss is an idiot. He reminds me of my stupid brothers, all bullying
and mouth and no brain.”
</p><!--l. 10764--><p class="indent" >  Her visual presence shows no signs of agitation in the VR. It is one of those little
paradoxes with the VR, one of the causative factors of the frequent outbursts of
mobile rage amongst kids who spend their time in this body-language inhibited
world.
</p><!--l. 10769--><p class="indent" >  “Bosses can be like that I suppose.”
</p><!--l. 10771--><p class="indent" >  “Not bosses. Men. Stupid idiotic men. Ninety percent ego and attitude and ten
percent intellect, if you&#x2019;re lucky!”
</p><!--l. 10774--><p class="indent" >  Bishop laughs. “I&#x2019;m sorry to hear that.”
</p><!--l. 10776--><p class="indent" >  “Oh! I&#x2019;m sorry,” she realizes. “I didn&#x2019;t mean to be rude. But you can&#x2019;t imagine what
it is like to grow up in a family like mine.”
</p><!--l. 10779--><p class="indent" >  “Trust me Preeta, I have been working with the police force for twenty years. I
know what men are like. I would like to be able to disagree with you, but I think your
characterization is accurate for a large number of men. Especially young
men.”
</p><!--l. 10784--><p class="indent" >  She nods. “Well. It happens all over the world all the time, so I wasn&#x2019;t worried
about that. I was just trying to do what was right for my job. I&#x2019;ve been trying to save to
come to Europe. To work here.”
</p><!--l. 10789--><p class="indent" >  “Now you are here. Or not.” He laughs at the irony of travelling half way around the
planet only to be back in the same simulated place, in a parallel universe. “When you
have learned to trust us, you can carry on working and help us at the same
time.”
</p><!--l. 10794--><p class="indent" >  “Do you have any family that you want to contact?”
</p><!--l. 10796--><p class="indent" >  “Just my colleagues.”
</p><!--l. 10798--><p class="indent" >  “We&#x2019;ll do that soon. When you have told me about the incident.”
</p><!--l. 10800--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I was walking down an all</span><span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">é. It was dark and I was joining a group, in my head.</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I was voting for my government, voting for my self-esteem. I was running</span>

<span

<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">dream was shattered by a screeching of tyres and a hand against my thigh. .</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">.</span>
</p><!--l. 10807--><p class="indent" >  Bishop cannot see her trauma, but his sixth sense can sense it.
</p><!--l. 10809--><p class="indent" >  “I have an idea,” he says. “We should change our appearances now – to match our
real ones. It will make it easier for us.”
</p><!--l. 10812--><p class="indent" >  She nods. It will be strange, like ripping the mask oﬀ a knight in shining armour
and ﬁnding the frog inside.
</p><!--l. 10815--><p class="indent" >  “I want to show you something,” Bishop says.
</p><!--l. 10817--><p class="indent" >  He ties their movements together and dials through the locations, back in
the real-world sims, the public spaces. They melt from one location into
another.
</p><!--l. 10821--><p class="indent" >  “Here is a place I like to come and watch,” he says.
</p><!--l. 10823--><p class="indent" >  There are people here. Hundreds of people. It is a shopping mall. They are reading
the ads, hearing the hymns, buying the products, wearing the clothes. They are
displaying the logos and ﬂying the corporate ﬂags. Each body is a hard-hitting tattoo,
a round of of symbolic gunﬁre.
</p><!--l. 10829--><p class="indent" >  “Especially after you and I ﬁrst talked.”
</p><!--l. 10831--><p class="indent" >  They see the people in their groups, but they are not together. They are marked as
ghosts in pairs and in small private groups, just as they are everywhere.
</p><!--l. 10835--><p class="indent" >  “This is something you will recognize.”
</p><!--l. 10838--><p class="indent" >  Instantly their picture is transformed, as if they were suddenly observing a camera
image in infra-red, or a computer enhanced image, nuclear magnetic resonance—and
they are able to see the game&#x2019;s projected bindings, the attractive forces that
are applied through the rules of the game to incite allegiance to the greatest
logos of them all. It is like having the veil of ignorance lifted from one&#x2019;s
eyes, and Preeta knows immediately that this is her doing. She has made this
possible.
</p><!--l. 10847--><p class="indent" >  “This is based on what you told me,” he says. “I got one of our programmers to
implement the idea you explained to me.”
</p><!--l. 10850--><p class="indent" >  She allows herself to feel a little pride. In the stream of coloured ribbons,
they can see the lines that bind the spectres of this public place in a way
that no ordinary participant could fathom; they can see all manner of things:
intentions, unexpected relationships, snaking patterns of cause and eﬀect, the
beginnings of prediction, and the very glimpses of the future that led her to the
inevitable conclusion: that the shallow manipulations of the game were far too
simplistic to thwart this kind of complexity. The game was a failure to its hopeful
designers.
</p><!--l. 10860--><p class="indent" >  In Kuala Lumpur, she saw all of that in her head, with a little help from the
computer. But here it is, now, all laid out in fantastic Technicolor, for everyone to see.
No one can fail to see it now. Will they hang her for passing on company secrets? No.
No sense in thinking like that. The idea was hers. No one asked her to come up with it.

It was one of her private pleasures, to pass the boredom of her real job. There was no
ethical breach in passing it onto the mystery X, even if there was a little bragging
involved.
</p><!--l. 10869--><p class="indent" >  She smiles to herself, behind the privacy of her VR headset and her representation
smiles with her, in full public view. She has always had the knack of being a step
ahead, but without giving away her full hand.. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">And that sort of brings us up the time</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">you freaked out</span>, she thinks. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">The time you ran,</span>
</p><!--l. 10875--><p class="indent" >  “All right,” she says, after a long pause. “I trust you.”
</p><!--l. 10877--><p class="indent" >  “Good.” He seems to pause in thought. “So then. Tell me everything that has
happened.”

<!--l. 10884--><p class="indent" >  She looks out of her dry, cardboard box onto the shiny black world beyond. No one
told her that it would be quite this cold and wet! It is not so much the temperature,
which hovers around zero, as the festering dampness, which triggers convulsions of
shivering in her. There are traces of snow lingering outside. She has not seen snow for
years.
</p><!--l. 10891--><p class="indent" >  Her ﬁrst impulse on arriving here, on awakening to a new day, was to ﬂee. How
could they possibly bring her to this place? It is like a new trap all over again. Is this
what life is about? Falling from old trap into new trap?
</p><!--l. 10896--><p class="indent" >  After these few days, she is growing vaguely accustomed to the strange
blue-grey light, of a world that seems to be locked in a perpetual sunrise or
dawn. This city, Oslo, seems like a chilly, frozen monument, lifeless in its
frigid greys. There is not a hint of the real life here to her eye; every building
meets the next, more like soldiers in formation than a family or clique of
friends. And this persistent rain removes any lingering colour from the scene,
except for the dark shades in a grey sky. It is solid and sturdy, but it is . . .
alien.
</p><!--l. 10908--><p class="indent" >  Sleeping with a heavy rug of feathers on top of her has also been a new experience.
Douvé. Dyne. How can anyone sleep with such a weight on top of them? The
alternative is to switch on a heater and lie naked: not a fan to cool her, but a panel
oven to warm the room. But then the air becomes so dry that she has woken
now several nights, feeling as though she has been dessicated for sale in a
supermarket.
</p><!--l. 10915--><p class="indent" >  No matter, she will adapt.
</p><!--l. 10917--><p class="indent" >  A plan for her days has been written for her. That&#x2019;s okay. It isn&#x2019;t too demanding.
Obviously having brought her here, they would want to get their money&#x2019;s worth. But
she also needs some time to think, to process. That time is now, in the waking hours,
while her body&#x2019;s clock is still confused by the travel and the darkness. Making kulﬁ

out of icicle pricks. Cinnamon thoughts.
</p><!--l. 10924--><p class="indent" >  Preeta heads out into the morning, wrapping up in her new clothes and braving the
outside temperature. In these early hours, she can feel more anonymous and therefore
more comfortable as she skulks around. She knows that her position is being
monitored, but that is just ﬁne. The clawing uncertainty of her physical security,
leaves her nervous of being alone, but somehow she feels more protected in all of
these padded garments. It is like a body armour. With a woolly hat on, they can hardly
see who she is.
</p><!--l. 10934--><p class="indent" >  Scattered diamonds on the dark green grasses glisten in this blue light. It seems like
another planet. And they say that soon it will be dark most of the time here soon. Only
the falling leaves, leaving small yellow-green paw-prints on the pavements, reveal any
sign that life has once been here to grace this planet with colour. Even the colourless
people shuﬄe past without life or vigour, making no eye contact, nor oﬀering any fuel
to warm the streets.
</p><!--l. 10942--><p class="indent" >  Preeta walks through the streets, through the centre of town, paying no attention to
which way she is going. If she gets lost, she can jump onto a tram. She just wants to
see this place. It is strange and exotic in some places, modern and futuristic in others,
and oddly unkempt here and there.
</p><!--l. 10948--><p class="indent" >  People walk in ones, never twos. They are wired up to their eyeballs and ears.
Every oriﬁce is distracted from the reality of the moment by a mobile conversation,
piped music played through little earphones, visual news summaries projected onto
their fashionable spectacles. Why do they need VR simulations, when they hide so
eﬀectively from the world right before their eyes?
</p><!--l. 10955--><p class="indent" >  Shards of squandered privacy open and infect her with other peoples&#x2019; aﬀairs.
</p><!--l. 10957--><p class="indent" >  “I think you should make it ﬁfty. If they go forward with this then. . ..”
</p><!--l. 10959--><p class="indent" >  “Anthony, this is not a game you know. You deﬁnitely need to get . . .”
</p><!--l. 10961--><p class="indent" >  Laughter. “It was just <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">so </span>amazing. You have never seen such tits. I mean I thought
the lads were going to cream themselves. . .wait a minute, some stupid bitch is in my
way. . .”
</p><!--l. 10965--><p class="indent" >  “Miriam here. I was wondering if you had the ﬁgures for January yet?”
</p><!--l. 10967--><p class="indent" >  At Riverside, there is a tramp with the shell of an old mobile handset. He is
pretending to talk to a ﬁctitious mother. There are no electronics in the shell, not
even a paper cup and string to carry his voice across the city, but the lure of
conformity is a powerful force, stronger than his deadened mind can resist. Not
even the humiliation of being caught out in an obvious lie, of having the
whole street look and laugh at his expense, is enough to assuage the futile
deception.
</p><!--l. 10976--><p class="indent" >  “Mamma. How are you today? You should keep away from that bottle you know. .
.”
</p><!--l. 10978--><p class="indent" >  How lonely it must be not to own a mobile, to ﬁnd oneself outside of the walls
of society, outside of the welfare net. These people deﬁne themselves by
their communications. The nasal drawl of the substance abusers rivets her
attention.

</p><!--l. 10983--><p class="indent" >  “Fuuucck. They took my dog and deaded it. Fucking police took my fucking dog.
Spare some change, lady?”
</p><!--l. 10986--><p class="indent" >  No one is giving. Too many are asking,
</p><!--l. 10988--><p class="indent" >  She ends up in a street of shops, where trams roll past and the occasional car
crackles along. There are more people here; she likes the activity. It seems that there
are so few people in this place.
</p><!--l. 10992--><p class="indent" >  A painted building catches her attention. An old fashioned, 1930&#x2019;s style
advertisement for chocolate is painted onto a rare space on the side of a building. It
adds a much wanted splash of warmth to the street. She greets it as she would a friend
or a member of kin.
</p><!--l. 10997--><p class="indent" >  Someone curses and she feels a thud. She hears a laugh as someone pushes her out
of the way. She was looking at the advertisement, she lost her awareness of the
people around her, of the distracted stampede. The man who bumped into
her is talking to someone with his mobile, not watching where he is going
either. She does not feel as though it was her fault, but she feels somehow
dislocated.
</p><!--l. 11004--><p class="indent" >  “You lost?” A chubby African woman, black as the night itself, is standing close by.
It is diﬃcult to see her with the bright lights of shop windows lighting her from
behind.
</p><!--l. 11008--><p class="indent" >  She shakes her head.
</p><!--l. 11010--><p class="indent" >  “You look like you&#x2019;re new here. Tourist?”
</p><!--l. 11012--><p class="indent" >  “Just visiting.”
</p><!--l. 11014--><p class="indent" >  Preeta sees her teeth now, bright and white, contrasting with her dark skip and
Negro lips. She seems to be standing in a doorway, waiting for a tram.
</p><!--l. 11018--><p class="indent" >  “You were looking a bit panicked.”
</p><!--l. 11020--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m new here.”
</p><!--l. 11022--><p class="indent" >  The Negro woman laughs warmly. “These white men and women are always in a
hurry. They can&#x2019;t wait for a moment to say something. Always stressin, out with the
mobile. . . Everything has to be done now. Interrupt anything for the mobile.” She
laughs again. “It&#x2019;s not like that where I come from.”
</p><!--l. 11028--><p class="indent" >  “Where&#x2019;s that?”
</p><!--l. 11030--><p class="indent" >  “Oh what do you think?”
</p><!--l. 11032--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m sorry. Africa?”
</p><!--l. 11034--><p class="indent" >  “Ivory Coast.”
</p><!--l. 11036--><p class="indent" >  Preeta shrugs. “Africa.”
</p><!--l. 11038--><p class="indent" >  “West Africa. We take things easy there. We don&#x2019;t need to hurry all the time. Slow
down!” She laughs.
</p><!--l. 11041--><p class="indent" >  “What are you here for?”
</p><!--l. 11043--><p class="indent" >  She laughs. “What are you ‘in&#x2019; for?! You make it sound like a prison sentence,
girl.”
</p><!--l. 11046--><p class="indent" >  “No, I didn&#x2019;t mean. . .”
</p><!--l. 11048--><p class="indent" >  She laughs. “Honey, take it easy. I was just laughing. You have to laugh.”
</p><!--l. 11050--><p class="indent" >  You have to laugh. Preeta wishes that she could feel the same way.

</p><!--l. 11052--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t take it all too seriously, child. It&#x2019;s an adventure!”
</p><!--l. 11054--><p class="indent" >  Preeta smiles at her, genuinely. It is the ﬁrst smile that she can remember feeling on
the inside. The ﬁrst smile that creases her eyes and cheeks. This woman does not
want anything from her. Her warmth is freely given; it is a random act of
generosity. In spite of her darkness, she shines with the warmth of a log ﬁre to
Preeta, amongst the cold, robotic ﬁgures who are streaming to their presumed
workplaces.
</p><!--l. 11061--><p class="indent" >  A tram rolls up, behind her. “This is me.”
</p><!--l. 11063--><p class="indent" >  Preeta lifts her head. Her face must have betrayed disappointment that the meeting
is over. The Negro woman seems to take pity on her.
</p><!--l. 11066--><p class="indent" >  “Listen, honey. Don&#x2019;t take it too seriously.”
</p><!--l. 11068--><p class="indent" >  She steps slowly onto the tram and holds onto a pole. She does not turn and wave
good-bye. The encounter is over; it meant nothing to her. She was just being
neighbourly, nothing more. She was not looking for friendship, simply interacting
with the world, unafraid.
</p><!--l. 11073--><p class="indent" >  Preeta watches the tram roll away.
</p><!--l. 11075--><p class="indent" >  She feels a vibration on her wrist. Her mobile has incoming. It is Bishop. She ﬂicks
it on.
</p><!--l. 11078--><p class="indent" >  “Hello?”
</p><!--l. 11080--><p class="indent" >  “Good morning. Did you sleep well.”
</p><!--l. 11082--><p class="indent" >  “Better. I&#x2019;ll get used to it.”
</p><!--l. 11084--><p class="indent" >  “I have some news about your friends at home. I can tell you when you come in.
We&#x2019;ll be meeting at nine o&#x2019;clock. Join us at the station then. okay?”
</p><!--l. 11088--><p class="indent" >  “Okay. I&#x2019;ll be there.”
</p><!--l. 11090--><p class="indent" >  “Everything okay?”
</p><!--l. 11092--><p class="indent" >  She nods. “I&#x2019;m just out for a walk. I&#x2019;ll check how to get back. Maybe there is a tram
I can catch?”
</p><!--l. 11095--><p class="indent" >  “Where are you?”
</p><!--l. 11097--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m not sure.”
</p><!--l. 11099--><p class="indent" >  Bishop laughs. “You&#x2019;ll be ﬁne. See you in a while.”

</p><!--l. 11105--><p class="indent" >  At the Los Angeles airport terminal, ﬂocks of passengers emerge from their
check-in lines in a cross-stream. People pour out of one queue and collide with those
from another with notable disregard for one another&#x2019;s predicament. They meet like
immiscible liquids, turbulent and unaware of one another.

</p><!--l. 11114--><p class="indent" >  Den fumes at the stupidity of it all. A woman practically walks into him.
Her vision is focused on an image behind her glasses, not on where she is
going.
</p><!--l. 11118--><p class="indent" >  Every year now, more and more people are killed in traﬃc because they were
looking elsewhere. People in cars and on foot, each of them believing that their
remote activities were more important than their physical well-being. Each
of them delegating the responsibility for their welfare to the world around
them.
</p><!--l. 11124--><p class="indent" >  Den sees that billboard again, the same one he saw in San Diego, but running in real
time now. He is not aware of any subliminal messages but he knows they are there,

buzzes once as it registers his check-in, and they tag his suitcase. There are seldom
long lines at airports these days, but trunk routes like this deal with hundreds
of passengers, and improved technology only makes people arrive later for
check-in.

incoming call. He looks groggily at his watch and sees that the call is from
Celia again. He touches the busy response and ﬂips the mobile into sleep
mode.
</p><!--l. 11200--><p class="indent" >  She&#x2019;s a sweet woman and she looks great, but he cannot let this get out of

</p><!--l. 11203--><p class="indent" >  Surfacing involuntarily from the light sleep, he feels stiﬀ and heavy headed, and
there is an excruciating pressure on his bladder. No choice but to get up and do

something about it.
</p><!--l. 11207--><p class="indent" >  He looks about him in the business cabin and sees that several of the other
passengers are sleeping in their little sarcophagi. He un-buckles his safety belt and
lifts himself up into a more vertical position from the seat-bed enclosure.

surely.

see how the other half lives.
</p><!--l. 11229--><p class="indent" >  People are more awake back here in the Morlock&#x2019;s realm. They do not have seats
that turn into beds like the privileged class. Den sees passengers sitting, row
upon row, in the darkness. Blue faces, lit by the entertainment screens that
hang in from of their eyes. Rows of numb faces peer willingly into media
captivity, absorbing the programmed material as if enacting a scene in some
Orwellian brainwashing farm. So docile, they look, so accepting of what they
have been served. It looks like a factory, a warehouse of consumer stock.
His trained eye can see the tell-tale signs of hidden billboards and directed
imaging in the movie presentations. A couple of passengers are playing the
game.
</p><!--l. 11241--><p class="indent" >  Den ﬁnds the washroom empty. Everyone is busily following the in-ﬂight
entertainment. He considers himself fortunate. He relieves himself and looks at his
calm visage in the mirror, recalling what it used to be like to travel economy.
He does not look as drawn and withered as the factory hens out there. He
could sleep some more, but perhaps it is a good time to catch up on a few
things.
</p><!--l. 11248--><p class="indent" >  He walks back up the plane, taking a sparkling water, bottled at low pressure, to
freshen up and morphs the bed into a seat, hooks into the console in his sarcophagus
and selects the game interface.

obviously engaged in a part of the game that requires a considerable eﬀort to blend in.
He attempts to interface his mobile with the aircraft systems, so that he can
access Mary directly, but his attempt fails. So much for in-ﬂight services. That
means he will only be able to access some of the lower level parts of the
game.

</p><!--l. 11264--><p class="indent" >  He ﬂicks through the menus, and ﬁnds only a handful of scenarios available.
They probably don&#x2019;t want any game scenarios on the plane that will agitate

about the protective enclosure of his apartment, with his books and his music that

</p><!--l. 11530--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s pronounced La Hoyya,” he corrects.
</p><!--l. 11532--><p class="indent" >  “Really? How strange. Is that Spanish or something?”
</p><!--l. 11534--><p class="indent" >  “I believe so.”
</p><!--l. 11536--><p class="indent" >  “Well, Mr. Brekken, there is a problem. The Norwegian authorities, following the
new E.U. guidelines, have new rules concerning the amount of support that a student
can receive in the space of a year when receiving income from another source.
There is now a request for funds for a visit to a cabin in the Jotunheimen
mountains. What is this? A holiday trip in the middle of her studies? This is very
irregular.”
</p><!--l. 11544--><p class="indent" >  “She has ﬁeldwork in Jotunheimen,” he say. “It&#x2019;s all above board.”
</p><!--l. 11546--><p class="indent" >  “But our rules don&#x2019;t allow us to make payments for board and lodgings unless the
trip is a scientiﬁc conference.”
</p><!--l. 11549--><p class="indent" >  “It is certainly a scientiﬁc trip.”
</p><!--l. 11551--><p class="indent" >  “We are only authorized to support conference visits.”
</p><!--l. 11553--><p class="indent" >  “We used to be able to decide these things at our own discretion.” Jonas feels the
blood starting to warm up inside of him. “We have plenty of residual funds, I am
pretty sure that there was no problem in taking the residuals from the previous

year.”
</p><!--l. 11558--><p class="indent" >  “Well that might be true, but there is another issue. Under the new guidelines from
the ministry, we are not allowed to pay something like this. It has to do with the State
Ledger. We cannot pay out such a small amount of money. Every payment has to be
marked by a government approved accountant. But with their minimum fees, that
means paying a fee that is about thirty percent of the value of the payment, in this
case. We could have done it earlier on, but the new rules tighten up controls
on these small payments. We are no longer allowed to waste money like
that.Had it been a scientiﬁc conference then we have special exemptions for
that.”
</p><!--l. 11569--><p class="indent" >  Jonas grimaces. “Yes, I know about that. Can&#x2019;t you allocate the payment from
somewhere else? The Ledger does not have to be involved if we can attach it to come
project expense. If we can transfer the amount from a diﬀerent account, then we can
lump the sum together with another payment from the account. Make it into a printing
expense or something.”
</p><!--l. 11576--><p class="indent" >  Katti Møller laughs. “If only it were that simple,” she says.
</p><!--l. 11578--><p class="indent" >  It could be. It should be. “Look, we have done this kind of thing before.”
</p><!--l. 11580--><p class="indent" >  “Well, if this student were ﬁnanced entirely by the research council it would
be a diﬀerent matter. Then we could make an exception, but in the general
paragraph about collaborative grants, we have to observe the conditions of the
agreement.”
</p><!--l. 11585--><p class="indent" >  “What about European funds?”
</p><!--l. 11587--><p class="indent" >  “No. The problem there is that the E.U. will not provide support to NASA-related
projects. The European Space Agency is a competitor so there is a conﬂict of
interest.”
</p><!--l. 11591--><p class="indent" >  “Well, ask NASA. It must be in their interests. I don&#x2019;t think Sara would go oﬀ into
the mountains at this time of year unless it was necessary. Perhaps you can get in
touch with the group from La Jolla who are over here working.”
</p><!--l. 11596--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ll have to ask my supervisor.”
</p><!--l. 11598--><p class="indent" >  “Well that would be me, wouldn&#x2019;t it?”
</p><!--l. 11600--><p class="indent" >  “Sorry, Mr. Brekken, but you are just the research coordinator. You don&#x2019;t have any
administrative authority.”
</p><!--l. 11603--><p class="indent" >  “Why doesn&#x2019;t that surprise me? Look, how are these requests coming in?”
</p><!--l. 11605--><p class="indent" >  “Direct transfer, request for payment from her mobile. It&#x2019;s on a credit agency, so the
bill does not have to be paid for a few weeks, but I have to mark it now for acceptance
or refuse it today.”
</p><!--l. 11609--><p class="indent" >  “I know that she has been trying to contact me,” Jonas thinks aloud. “She is not the
kind to ask if it were not absolutely necessary.”
</p><!--l. 11612--><p class="indent" >  “You know this girl?”
</p><!--l. 11614--><p class="indent" >  “I am partly responsible for the project. We should have plenty of funds.”
</p><!--l. 11617--><p class="indent" >  “There are no allocatable funds for travel on her account.”
</p><!--l. 11619--><p class="indent" >  “That cannot be right,” he mutters in exasperation. “I was at the meeting where
the funds were dealt out. I have the receipt that proves that the data were

submitted.”
</p><!--l. 11623--><p class="indent" >  “Well can you send me a copy?”
</p><!--l. 11625--><p class="indent" >  He ﬂips through the data areas on his mobile and conﬁrms what he already
suspected. It simply says ‘SonErikia: unknown data error&#x2019;.
</p><!--l. 11628--><p class="indent" >  “Well, normally I could, but something happened to my mobile the other day and it
has been acting up. I&#x2019;ll have to retrieve it from backup. Hopefully I can get it done
later today. But you will have to send me a signed request. Voice is not good enough
for this kind of request. We are not allowed to record voice mail. I am just getting an
error here.”
</p><!--l. 11634--><p class="indent" >  “Well, send it along. But I am guessing that there is loophole in the conditions on
that transfer.”
</p><!--l. 11637--><p class="indent" >  “So you&#x2019;re saying that she cannot be paid?”
</p><!--l. 11639--><p class="indent" >  “Well, not like this. I could refuse the request, then she would have to move the
request elsewhere. She could submit a larger amount for the full journey at a later
date, then that might exceed the limit of what we are allowed to pay out. Sorry, she
says. That&#x2019;s the government social sector for you.”
</p><!--l. 11645--><p class="indent" >  Fantastic, he thinks. That&#x2019;s the government for you, as if that were an acceptable
and unavoidable state of aﬀairs. Normally you&#x2019;re not allowed to spend too
much money. Here she is not allowed to spend so little money. There is no
way to satisfy the constraints, and he does not want to talk about this now.
“Look, I have to go now. Please try to ﬁnd a solution. I&#x2019;ll get back to you later
today.”
</p><!--l. 11653--><p class="indent" >  He archives the call with a note and reconsiders the door. He looks around his living
room, at his precious things, his comforting domicile and draws a breath for strength.
Does he have everything he needs? Can he face the world today? It could
be cold out there: perhaps minus ﬁve, or worse: plus one degree, with cold
damp humidity working its nebulous ﬁngers into every oriﬁce and interface
between skin and clothing. He feels tired, worn out. But the fresh air will
invigorate him, recharge him. So, he turns to the door resolutely. Okay, here we
go.
</p><!--l. 11663--><p class="indent" >  The mobile rings again. Cannot wait now, he has to leave. He opens the door, steps
into the dimly lit hallway and locks it behind him with his mobile and then
with a physical key. A neighbour is coming down the stairwell towards him.
Their eyes meet for a second in cold suspicion. The mobile is still ringing. It
is a good excuse. He lives next to these people; he is not obliged to talk to
them.
</p><!--l. 11670--><p class="indent" >  He looks away and accepts the incoming.
</p><!--l. 11672--><p class="indent" >  “Hello. Jonas.”
</p><!--l. 11674--><p class="indent" >  “Jonas, this is Anita.” From the oﬃce. It&#x2019;s eight o&#x2019;clock already. He is late. “Sorry
to bother you.”
</p><!--l. 11677--><p class="indent" >  “Hi. That&#x2019;s okay.”
</p><!--l. 11679--><p class="indent" >  “We just got a paper letter from the ministry of education. It&#x2019;s in reply to the letter
you wrote to the NATO liason in Brussels.”

</p><!--l. 11682--><p class="indent" >  “Ah.” He waits for the shock-wave and begins walking down the stairs, holding
onto the rail so that he can think as he walks. “Don&#x2019;t tell me. They have hired a hit
man to knock me oﬀ.” He remembers the shot from the other night. What <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">was</span>
that?
</p><!--l. 11687--><p class="indent" >  She laughs. “Well they haven&#x2019;t said as much, but that might be the next step. The
letter says that you are not authorized to send this kind of query and that, blahdy blah.
You should take a look at it. They want to send someone out here to meet
you.”
</p><!--l. 11692--><p class="indent" >  “To meet me?”
</p><!--l. 11694--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s what it says.”
</p><!--l. 11696--><p class="indent" >  “Someone from the ministry, or from NATO?”
</p><!--l. 11698--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I got an E-mail schedule request for a meeting with you, separately, from the
ministry. They are asking to see you today. That&#x2019;s why I called.”
</p><!--l. 11702--><p class="indent" >  Jonas reaches the bottom of the dingy stairwell; he bumps into the mailboxes as he
passes an elderly neighbour and heads out into the gloomy twilight of the
morning.
</p><!--l. 11706--><p class="indent" >  “I am going to be busy today. . .”
</p><!--l. 11708--><p class="indent" >  Jonas is painfully aware that the letter he wrote would not be kindly received. It felt
necessary to air his grievance nevertheless. Keeping his mouth shut has never been his
strong suit.
     <span 
class="ptmri7t-">Dear Brussels,</span><br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmri7t-"> </span><br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmri7t-">I am writing to express concern over the procedure currently being</span><br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmri7t-">used to fund collaboration under the NATO collaborative research grant</span><br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmri7t-">treaty. In recent times this has started to follow the trend of</span><br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmri7t-">Fulbright scholarships in directing research projects to political</span><br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmri7t-">goals rather than more general research issues that beneﬁt a</span><br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmri7t-">scientiﬁc community. This has resulted in a degradation of</span><br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmri7t-">established long term programmes of research that have gone on for</span><br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmri7t-">years. Some concern has been expressed here about the viability of</span><br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmri7t-">future work under this programme if this trend continues. We of the</span><br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmri7t-">Norwegian Research Council would therefore be grateful for a</span><br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmri7t-">clariﬁcation of oﬃcial policy on the assignment of these</span><br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmri7t-">grants. Yada Yada.</span>
</p><!--l. 11730--><p class="indent" >  Disillusionment with the reasons for research seems to be a topic for conversation
these days. The government has been persuaded that only projects with guaranteed
ﬁve year returns will be funded, unless they are politically beneﬁcial. It is no
longer about scholarships and learning, but about economic growth or arse
licking.
</p><!--l. 11736--><p class="indent" >  At ﬁrst, Norway was unwilling to fund research that was not directly related to
Norwegian industry. Then came pressure to enlarge the blessed Fulbright and NATO
scholarships and pure researchers went clammering to get dribs of money from
them. That eﬀectively meant that the Americans were deciding the pattern of

research for Norwegian Colleges. No money unless you comply with our
wishes.
</p><!--l. 11743--><p class="indent" >  Senator Fulbright, who created the initiative, saw these grants as a cultural
initiative. He said something like: “The dangers of war can be signiﬁcantly
reduced by producing generations of leaders who, through experience of
educational exchange, will have acquired the ways and means of living together in
peace.”
</p><!--l. 11749--><p class="indent" >  Nice idea. Pretty naive.
</p><!--l. 11751--><p class="indent" >  Maybe he could get one of the grants for Kaja.
</p><!--l. 11753--><p class="indent" >  “Can you ask them to re-schedule for tomorrow and, if they can&#x2019;t, make it about
two this afternoon.”
</p><!--l. 11756--><p class="indent" >  “Okay. Don&#x2019;t forget the meeting with CERN people from Bergen at twelve
thirty..”
</p><!--l. 11759--><p class="indent" >  “How could I?”
</p><!--l. 11761--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ll sort it out.”
</p><!--l. 11763--><p class="indent" >  “Thanks. Now I have to get a move on and pick up my kid. He&#x2019;s sick.”
</p><!--l. 11765--><p class="indent" >  “Okay, see you later.”
</p><!--l. 11767--><p class="indent" >  Enough. He puts the mobile handset on hold and stuﬀs it in his pocket.
</p><!--l. 11769--><p class="indent" >  He is tired of being a processor of verbal information. Jonas is not so old that he
cannot remember when things were simpler and mobiles were only there for
occasional use. People still used to look at each other in the street, back then, and talk
to each other as though they meant it.
</p><!--l. 11775--><p class="indent" >  Japan and Scandinavia. That&#x2019;s where it all started. They have a lot to answer for.
What other parts of the world are inhabited by people desperate to push others away,
afraid of personal contact, and contact-shy to the point of actual panic that they would
embrace mobile isolation?

<!--l. 11787--><p class="indent" >  He arrives at the City Gate shopping mall, driving oﬀ morning anxieties be sheer
eﬀort of will, as he always does.
</p><!--l. 11790--><p class="indent" >  Kaja works in the news-agent&#x2019;s shop/kiosk at the mall entrance to the central train
station. It is jammed in, next to a ﬂower shop that spills over into the mall entrance
with seasonal ﬂowers in whites and reds, and purples, broadcasting aromas to mingle
with wisps of brewing coﬀee. It opens early in the morning, like the newsagent. Kaja
would rather be working at the ﬂower shop; in her spare time she does ﬂower
arranging. The morning is a busy time at the station, what with commuters coming
and going and everything.
</p><!--l. 11800--><p class="indent" >  It is strange to see her here, in this setting. Kaja studied genetic programming at the
University. She is twelve years his junior. She was smart and motivated, but she

existed without direction and without ambition. She had a keen intellect; now she
chooses to suppress it.
</p><!--l. 11806--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">She could do so much more than this job she has now</span>, Jonas thinks.
</p><!--l. 11808--><p class="indent" >  Jonas walks through the rotating door of the mall entrance and sees that Kaja is by
herself with Martin behind the counter. Here she is, in this life that suits her, pushing
lifestyle magazines on the customers and chewing gum at the faceless mass of
commuters.
</p><!--l. 11813--><p class="indent" >  The manager is here too, at the other end of the little shop, setting out magazines.
He has seen her before. She looks at him, openly evaluating him. He wonders what
she sees. What has Kaja been saying about him?
</p><!--l. 11818--><p class="indent" >  The magazines scare him. Forget your life! Buy your dreams instead! Read of sex
and fantasy, of adventures you will never begin to surpass. Give up the struggle and be
content to read about what others might have done. Keep your head down, look after
yourself and your closest family and friends. Make no extraneous connections. It is
the modern way. It is the mobile way.
</p><!--l. 11825--><p class="indent" >  Kaja does not see him at once. Then she sees him and breaks an involuntary smile,
before recovering her composed annoyance. “You&#x2019;re late,” she says.
</p><!--l. 11829--><p class="indent" >  “Trams,” he replies simply. “Can&#x2019;t live with &#x2019;em, can&#x2019;t kill &#x2019;em.”
</p><!--l. 11831--><p class="indent" >  “You know where the doctor&#x2019;s is?”
</p><!--l. 11833--><p class="indent" >  “I have the address. I&#x2019;ll ﬁnd it.”
</p><!--l. 11835--><p class="indent" >  She nods. “I&#x2019;m done at four. I can come then. Where will you be?”
</p><!--l. 11837--><p class="indent" >  “At four? At the oﬃce.”
</p><!--l. 11839--><p class="indent" >  She nods and stoops to zip up Martin&#x2019;s jacket. “Martin, are you ready? You go with
your father now, okay?” She tests his forehead with a hot wodge of ﬁngers. “Still
feeling poorly?”
</p><!--l. 11843--><p class="indent" >  He nods with sulky eyes.
</p><!--l. 11845--><p class="indent" >  “Okay, baby. See you later.” She gives him a quick hug and oﬀers Jonas a simple
“Bye.”
</p><!--l. 11848--><p class="indent" >  Dismissed.
</p><!--l. 11850--><p class="indent" >  Together they step out into the electrical lighting of the morning. The sky is still
dark and mounds of blackened snow are melting around them. Martin walks slowly,
far away in a child&#x2019;s dream, eyes wandering and inquisitive of the passing
commuters.
</p><!--l. 11855--><p class="indent" >  A woman stands over a smashed mobile. She has slipped on the steps of the subway
and has smashed the transmitter into little pieces. It is broken. Gone. Her lifeline is
gone; the umbilical cordless broken. She is crying, looking around at the people
walking by helplessly, as if woken from a deep hypnosis, thrust suddenly into the jaws
of reality, and feeling so utterly alone that she must beg the faceless ﬂock
for their attention, for their assistance. They walk past, choosing not to see
her.
</p><!--l. 11864--><p class="indent" >  Martin&#x2019;s child-stare makes a momentary contact with hers, arresting her with
sudden compassion, and she feels a transitory fragment of hope. It fades to the
realization that, so naked, she is only a child herself, felled before the mercy of a

bewildered herd.
</p><!--l. 11869--><p class="indent" >  He walks past, trying not to look.

<!--l. 11876--><p class="indent" >  Kaja.
</p><!--l. 11878--><p class="indent" >  She had all the structure of a tornado: a whirling maelstrom of ﬂying debris,
whipped up in an involuntary frenzy. She was a force of nature then, sending
scourges of incisive needles in all directions. Every little pinprick hurt him. But
her control was only a threat of chaos; there was nothing considered about
it.
</p><!--l. 11884--><p class="indent" >  Kaja used to call him all the time, just to check on where he was and what he was
doing. It came to the point at which he was afraid to do anything, or meet anyone for
fear of her explosive reprisals.
</p><!--l. 11888--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Just because you love someone, it doesn&#x2019;t mean you can live with them.</span>
</p><!--l. 11890--><p class="indent" >  The life in her eyes, the moments of humour. They have not gone away, only been
soiled slightly under the detritus of age and disappointment. Kaja just wants
someone to rescue her from her own poverty of eﬀort, and from accursed
indecision.
</p><!--l. 11895--><p class="indent" >  His mobile buzzes on his wrist.
</p><!--l. 11897--><p class="indent" >  She is calling him, only moments after leaving with Martin.
</p><!--l. 11899--><p class="indent" >  “Yes?”
</p><!--l. 11901--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t forget to get him lunch, and give him a mouth cleaner afterwards.”
</p><!--l. 11903--><p class="indent" >  He terminates the discussion quickly. Martin looks up at him, as if expecting
something. Their child is like her, but quieter. Perhaps that will change as he grows.
He knows that he will demand his attention.
</p><!--l. 11908--><p class="indent" >  If truth be known, Jonas is secretly pleased to have this opportunity to walk along
Karl Johan with his boy, through the main streets of Oslo, with his little four year old.
If only this had been a better time, without the threat of tardiness hanging over him.
Martin does not really grasp his need for haste.
</p><!--l. 11915--><p class="indent" >  “So how are you feeling kiddo?”
</p><!--l. 11917--><p class="indent" >  He shrugs.
</p><!--l. 11919--><p class="indent" >  “Think you need some medicine?”
</p><!--l. 11921--><p class="indent" >  He shakes his head emphatically.
</p><!--l. 11923--><p class="indent" >  “Just want to spend the day with your dad?”
</p><!--l. 11925--><p class="indent" >  A slower, less certain nod.
</p><!--l. 11927--><p class="indent" >  Jonas smiles.
</p><!--l. 11929--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I don&#x2019;t want to work today either</span>, he thinks.
</p><!--l. 11932--><p class="indent" >  They traipse up Karl Johan, along the cobbled promenade under the trees, past the
shops and University square buildings, up towards the palace park.

</p><!--l. 11946--><p class="indent" >  She explains that she is in the Jotunheimen range and that she needs to spend some
time there to try to meet the nursemaiding team. There is some kind of problem with
her work. The rest of the message is broken oﬀ. He knows her only superﬁcially, but
he likes her. She is smart and all the things that Kaja could be. Probably, he ought to
be attracted to her, but she is too young, too emotionally shallow for his taste.
Nevertheless, she is probably worried. He should try to call her. Perhaps this is a good
time, while his activities are restricted, while he is prevented from doing much
else.
</p><!--l. 11956--><p class="indent" >  It is almost nine o&#x2019;clock and they are still barely approaching the old university
square. There is no snow here. It has melted along the main street; heating cables
dissolve it away almost as soon as it falls. Small mercies. Even the trees drip dry
quickly above the path. It makes ‘the going quicker and the coming back&#x2019;, as the old
ad used to say.
</p><!--l. 11963--><p class="indent" >  Martin is being diﬃcult, stopping at every shop window to look at things, dawdling
behind. Jonas is growing more and more agitated with his own inability to quell
frustration. He will probably be late for his ﬁrst meeting.
</p><!--l. 11968--><p class="indent" >  For the child, he thinks, that is the only power one exerts: the power to confound
the adult world. It is a frustrating life, always in the way and never really being taken
seriously.
</p><!--l. 11972--><p class="indent" >  Stop, start, stop, ready, go.
</p><!--l. 11974--><p class="indent" >  He stops to wait as Martin looks in the window of a music shop, examining the
classic album covers and printed glyphs of dancing notes on ruled staves. This
excursion is taking so long that he ought to turn disadvantage into opportunity. It is an
opportunity to call Sara back in real-time, in synchrony: with his real voice.
Besides, it is about time he spoke to her about her work. He has been neglecting
responsibility.
</p><!--l. 11982--><p class="indent" >  He hits callback and waits for a ring-tone.
</p><!--l. 11984--><p class="indent" >  The clicking pause of the searching thought ensues. He awaits the ring, looking
around at the emptying street and feeling a surge of optimism at the brightening sky.
Click, pause . . . Vast machines must be in motion, slumbering mechanisms brought to
life by his request; swinging cranes moving huge bars into place, electrical discharges
and blistering arrays of relays moving together to build a connection across the span
of air and earth, in search of her. The pause lasts too long. It fails to bridge the
unknown.

</p><!--l. 11993--><p class="indent" >  <span

</p><!--l. 11996--><p class="indent" >  His own mobile responds to its failure by producing an alarm. He pulls out the

diagnostic at ﬁrst available opportunity.
</p><!--l. 12000--><p class="indent" >  A possible virus warning. He recalls the other evening. A virus?
</p><!--l. 12003--><p class="indent" >  Now Martin is playing in a pile of sodden leaves, kicking and bending down to
sample the colours and shapes. To Jonas they are a pastiche, a parody of expired
hope. To a child they are just a palette of shapes and colours. Everything falls
and decays to nothing, to be re-used in a diﬀerent scheme. Use it as you
will.

<!--l. 12019--><p class="indent" >  Jonas and Martin take lunch in the Lighthouse café on the university college
campus, close to his oﬃce building. There is a cheap access point in the cafe, where
they have parked themselves; Jonas uses the opportunity to re-install his mobile from
backup.
</p><!--l. 12024--><p class="indent" >  A group of teenage girls is loitering beyond the window, on the periphery of the
college, wrapped up in their winter coats. They should be in school, but it is not
uncommon to see kids skulking about in prototypical gangs.
</p><!--l. 12029--><p class="indent" >  Their mobiles are fashion accessories now, he observes. Skin-tight, black, brushed
denim with wires running up the legs from their boots, ﬁtted with chargers; they make
eﬀective antennae. Their ear decorations are just a little too large for the
ones with short hair. The throat-band collar microphones look good enough.
None of this equipment is allowed in schools for tests or exams, of course.
It would be trivial for them to cheat. But isn&#x2019;t all of society cheating these
days?
</p><!--l. 12038--><p class="indent" >  The school kids are playing with a hand-held set, probably some kind of VR game.
Everyone seems to be playing them lately, since the allegations about the global game
consortium. He queries the fascination they hold. Games have never really been his
thing. He was always more interested in the so-called ‘real&#x2019; world. How long will it be
before Martin wants a mobile?
</p><!--l. 12047--><p class="indent" >  Next to the girls is an older man, perhaps in his late thirties who is loitering with
them. He is wearing a brown leather jacket and black denims. His hair is razor short.
He looks eastern European. He looks like a dealer or a pimp. This can hardly be a
good thing, Jonas frets. Whatever reason they have for being with him, it cannot be to
their advantage.
</p><!--l. 12054--><p class="indent" >  His mobile ﬁnishes its re-installation. It performs a self-test and rings immediately

on completion. He looks for a caller I.D. but the screen is blank. Startled,
he considers dropping the call, but sheer habit makes him click involuntary
acceptance.
</p><!--l. 12059--><p class="indent" >  “Hello?”
</p><!--l. 12061--><p class="indent" >  A high pitched, almost comical, foreign voice answers. “Jonas Lindgren?”
</p><!--l. 12063--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s right.”
</p><!--l. 12065--><p class="indent" >  “My name is Ducic.” He seems to be in a car somewhere. Sounds of rushing,
humming, invade the background noise. “Forgive this intrusion.”
</p><!--l. 12068--><p class="indent" >  “What can I do for you?”
</p><!--l. 12070--><p class="indent" >  “What indeed! I would like to ask you for your assistance. Perhaps we can do
something for one another.”
</p><!--l. 12073--><p class="indent" >  Jonas brushes Martin&#x2019;s hair from his eyes as he digs in to a tub of creamed rice. It is
easy to be distracted in the lunch time rush. People are crowding into the Lighthouse.
“Go ahead.”
</p><!--l. 12077--><p class="indent" >  “I represent an organization that works in security. I have some interest
in a project that you know about and would like to talk to you about your
work.”
</p><!--l. 12081--><p class="indent" >  “Have you been in touch with our outreach department?” Jonas suggests, absently,
following the antics of the kids outside, out of fascination.
</p><!--l. 12085--><p class="indent" >  “No, I would like to talk to you, in person, if I may.”
</p><!--l. 12087--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I am rather busy, but I have a little time. Our outreach department has
excellent resources for discussing . . .”
</p><!--l. 12090--><p class="indent" >  The voice interrupts him ﬁrmly but not impolitely. “It is your personal work that
interests me. I understand that you are funding work in the Norwegian Research
Council that is connected to covert operations and law enforcement methods in virtual
reality games.”
</p><!--l. 12096--><p class="indent" >  Jonas wrinkles his eyebrows. “I&#x2019;m not sure what you are thinking of. I can&#x2019;t think
of . . .”
</p><!--l. 12099--><p class="indent" >  ”My organization is following the developments in the virtual reality game
run by the international game consortium. We are particularly interested in
technologies for tracing criminal inﬂuences. We have found a project that you have
been involved with that seems to propose using the game for such covert
operations.”
</p><!--l. 12105--><p class="indent" >  “I have no idea what you are talking about, Mr..? What did you say you name
was?”
</p><!--l. 12108--><p class="indent" >  “Ducic.”
</p><!--l. 12110--><p class="indent" >  “Perhaps you are mixing me up with someone else. I cannot think what it is that
you have heard. I am certainly not aware of any such project.”
</p><!--l. 12114--><p class="indent" >  “I understand that you might not want to discuss this over an open channel.”
</p><!--l. 12116--><p class="indent" >  Martin is struggling to drink his pop from a half litre beer glass, and he loses track
of the conversation momentarily.
</p><!--l. 12119--><p class="indent" >  “Eh. No, this line is ﬁne. There is . . .eh . . .”

</p><!--l. 12121--><p class="indent" >  “Our search worms have discovered references to a classiﬁed project. The title was
not well hidden, but we are not aware of its contents. The title is <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Game theoretical</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">strategies for agent deployment in virtual landscapes</span>. S.V. Stensrud et al. Your name
is mentioned.”
</p><!--l. 12127--><p class="indent" >  Jonas suppresses a laugh. “Oh I see. Eh, look, Mr. Ducic, I think you have
misunderstood here. . .”
</p><!--l. 12130--><p class="indent" >  “Oh? How so?”
</p><!--l. 12132--><p class="indent" >  “The report is not what you think. It is a student project. It has nothing to do with
security.”
</p><!--l. 12135--><p class="indent" >  “That is not how it appears. Of course, there is no document classiﬁcation for the
report, which is curious in itself. Why would one classify a student project unless it
was in the interests of security?”
</p><!--l. 12139--><p class="indent" >  “Uh. I am sure there is a classiﬁcation, but the document is not available for general
viewing yet, so you won&#x2019;t be able to see it. That is probably a bug in our library
pages.”
</p><!--l. 12143--><p class="indent" >  “And you are telling me that I am wasting my time here?”
</p><!--l. 12145--><p class="indent" >  “It would seem so, if you are looking for security matters.”
</p><!--l. 12147--><p class="indent" >  The man sighs grumpily. “My organization is extremely interested in the methods
that are apparently being developed for tracking objects and people in the virtual
reality. We are willing to pay for access to this information.”
</p><!--l. 12152--><p class="indent" >  Jonas shakes his head and winks to Martin. “If you want to pay for access to this
project then you need to contact the project initiators. We are currently bound by a
non-disclosure agreement we long as the commercial potential of the work has not
been fully developed. But even so. . .”
</p><!--l. 12157--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, yes. You are going to tell me that I am wasting my time because this is not
what I am looking for.”
</p><!--l. 12160--><p class="indent" >  “I think so.”
</p><!--l. 12162--><p class="indent" >  “And yet this is all very suspicious: work on virtual reality in collaboration with
government funded institutions known to develop covert technologies. A classiﬁed
report without so much as a document classiﬁcation. . .”
</p><!--l. 12167--><p class="indent" >  “First of all this is not a classiﬁed report. But it is not for public viewing
yet.”
</p><!--l. 12170--><p class="indent" >  Ducic laughs. “There is a diﬀerence?”
</p><!--l. 12173--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, of course there is. Secondly, you seem to have the wrong end of the stick
about this project. This is a project in <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">eco-computing</span>. It has nothing to do with
security. It is about control theory.”
</p><!--l. 12177--><p class="indent" >  “Controlling users&#x2019; behaviours in this game?”
</p><!--l. 12179--><p class="indent" >  “No, no, nothing like that. It is about collaborative systems.”
</p><!--l. 12181--><p class="indent" >  “Make up your mind, sir. Your cover story is not very consistent.”
</p><!--l. 12183--><p class="indent" >  “There is not cover story,” Jonas spells out, pointedly. “You have simply been
misled by an unfortunate coincidence of words with multiple interpretations.”
</p><!--l. 12187--><p class="indent" >  “Come Mr. Lindgren. We have been following a variety of developments and there
is a clear connection between this project and the virtual reality games. We have

paid a lot of money for our searching software and it is very good. It does
not make many mistakes. We also know that research is being carried out
within the European Economic Area deploying law enforcement into the
Net.”
</p><!--l. 12194--><p class="indent" >  “If there is any connection to the virtual reality games you are thinking of it does
not go beyond normal methods of simulation. Virtual landscape models are used
in a variety of projects that we support at the research council. And as you
rightly say, there is a general European initiative to develop virtual modelling
for a variety of applications, but that is not really the work of the research
council.”
</p><!--l. 12201--><p class="indent" >  “What interests me is that this project I refer to is linked to the American
government. . .”
</p><!--l. 12204--><p class="indent" >  “It is a collaborative project with partial American funding” he agrees. “That is
probably what you have read.”
</p><!--l. 12207--><p class="indent" >  “And how exactly does the American funding ﬁnd its way into a project here in the
Norwegian capital?”
</p><!--l. 12210--><p class="indent" >  “We have a lot of good software people here. We are still part of NATO. Why
shouldn&#x2019;t we be involved? Norway is a major player in. . .”
</p><!--l. 12213--><p class="indent" >  “Our search software ﬁnd a very high probability that this project is, in fact, related
to the current rumours about the use of the game for spreading the agenda of the
United States government. Do you deny this?”
</p><!--l. 12218--><p class="indent" >  “Excuse me, Mr. Ducic. Are you working for the press?”
</p><!--l. 12220--><p class="indent" >  “No, no. I am not here to make trouble for you with the media. We are interested in
this technology, nothing else.”
</p><!--l. 12223--><p class="indent" >  Jonas frowns, a deep frown. “It is a special initiative project in collaboration with
NASA and the European and Russian space agencies. Norway is a key player because
we have skills in this area. I am sure that you could verify that with your search
software.”
</p><!--l. 12228--><p class="indent" >  “Well, if that is true we shall certainly do that. But our own monitoring has shown
us that this Stensrud has activities in the VR game that do not entirely ﬁt into your
scenario.”
</p><!--l. 12232--><p class="indent" >  “What kind of activities? How could you know this? What kind of organization is it
that you are working for?”
</p><!--l. 12235--><p class="indent" >  “Covert activities, Mr. Lindgren.”
</p><!--l. 12237--><p class="indent" >  “No. Don&#x2019;t be silly.”
</p><!--l. 12239--><p class="indent" >  “Our own investigators have veriﬁed this.”
</p><!--l. 12241--><p class="indent" >  Jonas ﬂounders. “Perhaps it is about time you told me who you are.”
</p><!--l. 12243--><p class="indent" >  “That is not important for you to know. Only that I represent a very large
organization and we want this game tracking technology.”
</p><!--l. 12246--><p class="indent" >  “No, no. You have this all wrong. I think you are barking up the wrong tree here.
The work is nothing to do with this kids&#x2019; game. You see the word ‘game&#x2019;, in the title
you quoted, does not refer to the virtual reality game, as in these virtual reality games
that you seem to be referring to. It refers to method of strategic modelling, used in

agent systems. . .”
</p><!--l. 12253--><p class="indent" >  “Agents. Precisely. We do not have to mince words. Undercover agents inside the
game is a topic of great interest. . .”
</p><!--l. 12256--><p class="indent" >  Jonas shakes his head, his face lined with dismay and displeasure. “No, dammit,
you don&#x2019;t understand. An agent is not a secret service agent. it is a computer program.
. .”
</p><!--l. 12260--><p class="indent" >  “Of course, this is the modern technology. Then you have computer programs that
behave as agents.”
</p><!--l. 12263--><p class="indent" >  “I think you need to do some more research on this matter. You don&#x2019;t seem to. .
.”
</p><!--l. 12266--><p class="indent" >  “My superiors have asked me to look into this matter and I come to you because
you seem to be a man of inﬂuence in this project. I could try to go to the Americans,
but I think I am more likely to reach my goal through you. I need to secure access to
this project.”
</p><!--l. 12271--><p class="indent" >  Jonas ﬁnds himself growing impatient. “Look, Mr. Ducic. I really am very busy and
this is not a good time for me. I suggest you talk to our outreach department and let
them convince you that . . .”
</p><!--l. 12275--><p class="indent" >  The high pitched voice matches his impatience and seems to ratchet up a level. “I
am not going to be put oﬀ by a publicity barrier. I am no fool, Mr. Lindgren and I
intend to get the details here. If there is a technology that is able to trace criminal
activity. . .”
</p><!--l. 12280--><p class="indent" >  “The technology is designed to allow robot agents to patrol terrain on other
worlds.” Jonas almost raises his voice now, and Martin looks worriedly at him. “The
title you have seen was an early phase of that project research, that used computer
simulated terrain models to test out the strategies. That is why is refers to virtual
landscapes.”
</p><!--l. 12287--><p class="indent" >  “I understand that you do not want to discuss this on an open channel. perhaps I
could join you at the café where you are eating.”
</p><!--l. 12291--><p class="indent" >  “How do you know that I am at a café?”
</p><!--l. 12293--><p class="indent" >  “I know my job, sir. And I want to know more about this technology.”
</p><!--l. 12295--><p class="indent" >  Jonas checks the caller info. The screen is blank.
</p><!--l. 12297--><p class="indent" >  “I have someone watching you now.”
</p><!--l. 12299--><p class="indent" >  “You what?”
</p><!--l. 12301--><p class="indent" >  “I am able to follow your movements and I am insisting on your cooperation.”
</p><!--l. 12303--><p class="indent" >  “All right. You are starting to annoy me, Mr. Ducic, or whatever your name is. I
have tried to be polite.”
</p><!--l. 12306--><p class="indent" >  “But not very helpful. I see that you have found our little surveillance program. We
have been following you for a couple of days. You might remember that we left a
calling card as you were walking home on Tuesday?”
</p><!--l. 12310--><p class="indent" >  Jonas&#x2019; eyes widen like sails unfurled to catch the full impact of the wind. “That&#x2019;s it.
I am ending this discussion here and I will be forced to report this matter the
police.”

</p><!--l. 12315--><p class="indent" >  “That will not help you. I suggest that you do not. It will only complicate our
interaction.”
</p><!--l. 12318--><p class="indent" >  “What is it you want?”
</p><!--l. 12320--><p class="indent" >  “I have told you what we want.”
</p><!--l. 12322--><p class="indent" >  “But you are not being rational. What you are suggesting is simply not
real.”
</p><!--l. 12325--><p class="indent" >  Ducic laughs. “What is real anymore?”
</p><!--l. 12327--><p class="indent" >  “Threats are real, and I do not appreciate them.” Martin is staring up at him with a
solemn face and sulky, intense eyes.
</p><!--l. 12330--><p class="indent" >  “We can also contact this Stensrud. We know that he is somewhere in the
Norwegian midlands mountain area.”
</p><!--l. 12333--><p class="indent" >  He? Apparently they do not know everything. “How do you know this?”
</p><!--l. 12335--><p class="indent" >  “That is not important.”
</p><!--l. 12337--><p class="indent" >  “Are you following . . . him too?”
</p><!--l. 12339--><p class="indent" >  “We would like to take part in this project, so that we may develop the technology
for our own, say, law enforcement. We shall do what we must to make you
cooperate.”
</p><!--l. 12343--><p class="indent" >  Jonas breaks the call and ﬁnds that he is trembling. He sees Martin&#x2019;s worried
look, sensing his unease and tries to conceal his fears with a half-successful
smile.
</p><!--l. 12347--><p class="indent" >  What the hell is going on here? How does someone like him get into something like
this. Is society falling apart completely?
</p><!--l. 12350--><p class="indent" >  This is surely what happens when ignorance triumphs over common sense. If
people had as much education as they had access to information, they would realize
that they were way oﬀ base here. He should tell Sara about this, but she seems to be
out of range. He must go to the police.
</p><!--l. 12356--><p class="indent" >  Jonas looks down at his mobile handset, his wristwatch and he feels the presence of
his ear piece and throat microphone; he sees these innocent components in a
completely new light. It is no longer his friend, his diary, his wallet, his telephone, his
personal computer,. . . It is something sinister, something malevolent. A friend has
suddenly become his enemy. It sends a shaft of something through him that he cannot
describe. Violation. He feels violated. What else do they know about him? How can
he feel safe again?
</p><!--l. 12365--><p class="indent" >  He glances uneasily at Martin&#x2019;s sullen expression and wonders if the man will call
back. He said he was watching them. My god.
</p><!--l. 12368--><p class="indent" >  His gaze strays back outside, through the window. The group of girls, at the college
perimeter, are now looking straight at them and seem to wave cheekily to him and to
Martin, as one might wave to a small child.

<span 
class="ptmb7t-x-x-248">25</span>
</p><!--l. 12376--><p class="indent" >  Winter is edging towards her. Snow ﬂakes are falling again, more softly now,
sprinkled against the darkening backdrop of the sky. Through a sliver of a gap in her
bivvy bag, she can still feel a world transformed to ice since this afternoon. She zips
up the gap hurriedly and opens the breathing vent, trying to breath slowly
through her nose, so as not to ﬁll up the little sanctuary with squandered
moisture.
</p><!--l. 12384--><p class="indent" >  Sara has had to ‘dig down&#x2019; in the sudden snowfall, not literally. It&#x2019;s just an
expression. She has unpacked this ultra-light inﬂatable bivvy bag, something like a
small tent, and has crept into it, pulling her small inner-backpack in with her, and
leaving the outer shell with the elements. The weather is too bad to travel now; she has
to think about survival.
</p><!--l. 12391--><p class="indent" >  After ﬁnding the place where the VeiVeks&#x2019; transmitter should have been, but
wasn&#x2019;t, the weather worsened quickly and she was plunged into cloud and snow, while
descending the mounting, back to the path.
</p><!--l. 12396--><p class="indent" >  The biggest danger at a time like this is that of a whiteout, where sky and ground
merge into one featureless bright blaze of inscrutable whiteness. A misty realm
of absolute danger. In those conditions a mountaineer cannot tell up from
down, slope from ﬂat, hole from ﬁrm-footing. One cannot measure speed or
distance, except by the sudden surprise impacts of gravity. Without a tracker
she would be lost. Normally her mobile would be able to guide her, but in a
white-out you cannot tell ground from sky; she could walk over a cliﬀ without
knowing it, fall into a hole, or break her leg on something in a heartbeat.
One might as well be blind: all black or all white, take your pick. Contrast is
survival.
</p><!--l. 12408--><p class="indent" >  Necessity speaks in such moments: unpack the inﬂatable survival bag and anchor it
to some rocks before they disappeared entirely from view. The wind, at least, has died
down, now away from the summit, and this has allowed her to complete the operation
of setting up her shelter in just a few minutes. But she is already cold to the

bone.
</p><!--l. 12415--><p class="indent" >  Now, here inside the warm bag, she has thawed out and is lying in relative
comfort while the weather stages its show outside. She is a little hungry, that
will get worse as she rests, but she has some pills and some chocolate to
keep it under control. She will be able to sleep and then she can spoil herself
tomorrow.
</p><!--l. 12422--><p class="indent" >  She digs out a little lightweight chemical boiler from her inner-backpack and places
it at the ready. The snow will make her a decent cup of tea later to replace
some of the ﬂuids that she has gasped in expiration across the mountain. And
as long as a mobile signal breaks through the weather, Vibe uses the time
in the bag to relay her position to cabin and to her team-mates whom she
was supposed to be heading towards, and do a little research. Even with a
little technological help, it doesn&#x2019;t hurt to follow the mountain rules and tell
someone where you are. Probably she wouldn&#x2019;t have made it to the cabin
anyway.
</p><!--l. 12433--><p class="indent" >  She runs a check on her little children. The ﬂimsy robots are relocating, running
away from the snow, as they should. Making them resilient is one thing, but the falling
snow confuses their sensory apparatus and makes it close to impossible for them to
walk. She can still reach their own private, <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">ad hoc </span>network of relay chatter from
here, and see that, even without their controller, they are managing to group
sensibly into small collaborative communities. She smiles at her handiwork,
and part of her hopes that the American team is as impressed with it as she
is.
</p><!--l. 12443--><p class="indent" >  She texts some meaningless banter to Bea and gets only a distracted reply. In the
half darkness of the translucent bag, she spoils herself by dialling up some music on
her mobile. Something classical would normally be her preference to go along with
nature, but in this weather she would not be able to hear it. Bass and drums are
required now.
</p><!--l. 12449--><p class="indent" >  After a while, the warming elements in the bag lull her into a stupor and she dozes
oﬀ.
</p>
<div class="center"

<!--l. 12452--><p class="noindent" >
</p><!--l. 12453--><p class="noindent" >*</p></div>
<!--l. 12456--><p class="indent" >  She awakens hours later, in the early morning, feeling calm but stiﬀ. Even through
the snow-buried bag, she can see that it is a bright, ﬁne morning, which is
good because she really has to crawl the hell out of this thing now to tend to
her aching bladder. Time to get up and make her way to the cabin, where
the French team is hopefully still waiting for her, where she will rest for a
day.
</p><!--l. 12463--><p class="indent" >  Vibe unfastens the bivvy bag seams and is assaulted by icy-cold air and a visual

feast. The morning declares a fantastic transformation, an accomplishment that
mountains can deliver. The clouds seem to have self-destructed, moving respectfully
aside for a velvet blue sky and warming sunshine.
</p><!--l. 12469--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Perfection on a stick!</span>
</p><!--l. 12471--><p class="indent" >  She ﬁnds boots, in the outer pocket of her bag, and shelter behind a cairn to relieve
her suﬀering and clean herself. With a refreshed outlook, she can see where she is
and how far she has to go to make it down to the valley. The path has been
subsumed by the light snow cover, but she can still guess the trail. There are no
real trails in the mountains anyway. You just ﬁnd your way, any way you
can.
</p><!--l. 12478--><p class="indent" >  She dusts melting snow oﬀ the bivvy bag and deﬂates it, folding it into a slightly
larger package than she removed it from. It will dry out during her walk. She fastens it
to the outside of her backpack and gathers her items together, regarding her sack with
some trepidation. Her body aches from head to toe this morning and. in spite of
some stretching exercises, she doubts her ability to bear the load without
complaint.
</p><!--l. 12486--><p class="indent" >  The bouldery landscape dissolves into a browner valley, far below, where snow fell
as rain. It will take her an hour perhaps to make it down to the valley and then several
more to get to the cabin. Better to start now. Going down hill with a heavy sack, on
slippery rocks, is going to be a nightmare.
</p><!--l. 12492--><p class="indent" >  She adjusts her mobile accessories and dials up her shortcuts to see if Bea is awake.
It is six in the morning, but Bea&#x2019;s mobile is still saying that she is awake. She gets
voice-only immediately.
</p><!--l. 12496--><p class="indent" >  “Bea? Talk to me girl.” She can hear music and the voices of a crowd, a
party.
</p><!--l. 12499--><p class="indent" >  “Hey you. Where are you? Still hiding in your bag?” She laughs.
</p><!--l. 12501--><p class="indent" >  “No. I am oﬃcially a butterﬂy. I&#x2019;m at the top of mount Doom, looking out on the
fairy world of Jotunheimen. I&#x2019;m cold and I&#x2019;m hungry, I got my period and I haven&#x2019;t
spoken to a living soul for more than a day.”
</p><!--l. 12506--><p class="indent" >  “Poor thing! At least you&#x2019;re safe.”
</p><!--l. 12508--><p class="indent" >  “What&#x2019;s up with you?”
</p><!--l. 12510--><p class="indent" >  “Still partying. Nachspiel. Getting tired though. I should go home soon. Fella
is still convinced he can get his leg over, but he can&#x2019;t even keep his eyes
open.”
</p><!--l. 12514--><p class="indent" >  “Anything I should know about?”
</p><!--l. 12516--><p class="indent" >  “Not.”
</p><!--l. 12518--><p class="indent" >  “Good, I don&#x2019;t want to feel I&#x2019;m missing out on everything being up here.”
</p><!--l. 12520--><p class="indent" >  “Hey – we are the ones missing out. Actually, I wish I was there with you. The
partying is okay but it&#x2019;s not quite the same without my girl!”
</p><!--l. 12523--><p class="indent" >  “Golly, matey! You talkin&#x2019; &#x2019;bout lill ol&#x2019; me?”
</p><!--l. 12525--><p class="indent" >  “Like no other,” she acts. “Seriously, when are you coming home?”
</p><!--l. 12527--><p class="indent" >  “Hmmm. Good question. Looks like I&#x2019;m going to be here for a while.”
</p><!--l. 12529--><p class="indent" >  “Problems? . . .. no . . .get oﬀ me jerk!. . . Sorry. Problems?”

</p><!--l. 12531--><p class="indent" >  “Maybe. Maybe its actually a good thing.”
</p><!--l. 12533--><p class="indent" >  “You mean you can still meet Mr. Universe?”
</p><!--l. 12535--><p class="indent" >  “Please! Give a girl a break here!”
</p><!--l. 12537--><p class="indent" >  “Sorry, you just make it so easy to have a little fun.”
</p><!--l. 12539--><p class="indent" >  “No, that&#x2019;s not what I meant. It&#x2019;s just easier to think out here. It&#x2019;s peaceful, you
know. In the city there&#x2019;s always something in your face, some billboard or a sound, or
someone talking. It&#x2019;s like my brain is full up just dealing with all the crap. Here I can
walk – well, let&#x2019;s call that a hobble – whatever – and then I can just, like, think for
hours on end. ”
</p><!--l. 12546--><p class="indent" >  “How very very cool,” she laughs.
</p><!--l. 12548--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t mock it, I&#x2019;m betting you that by the time I make the cabin this
afternoon, my liddle ol&#x2019; brain has come up with this ultra smart solution to all my
problems.”
</p><!--l. 12552--><p class="indent" >  “Damn! Can you take this and get me a towel? . . . Uh sorry, not you. Idiot here.
What did you say?”
</p><!--l. 12555--><p class="indent" >  “Never mind.”
</p><!--l. 12557--><p class="indent" >  “So, you&#x2019;re going to see spider ﬁngers?”
</p><!--l. 12559--><p class="indent" >  “Bea, you are just so drunk. I am going to murder you when I get back there. Don&#x2019;t
make me come down this mountain and all the way home just to beat you senseless,
girl.”
</p><!--l. 12563--><p class="indent" >  “Let&#x2019;s face it, you love me really.”
</p><!--l. 12565--><p class="indent" >  “Right.”
</p><!--l. 12567--><p class="indent" >  “So are you?”
</p><!--l. 12570--><p class="indent" >  “Am I what?”
</p><!--l. 12572--><p class="indent" >  “Going to see him now?”
</p><!--l. 12574--><p class="indent" >  She stops her walking and takes a breath. “I don&#x2019;t know.” She shakes her head, as if
to share her emptiness with the rocks. “I have no idea if he&#x2019;s even there with them. In
fact I don&#x2019;t know anything. It&#x2019;s seriously weird.”
</p><!--l. 12579--><p class="indent" >  “I told you you&#x2019;re crazy.”
</p><!--l. 12581--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah. Anyway, weren&#x2019;t you going out with Toril?”
</p><!--l. 12583--><p class="indent" >  “Toril is in hiding.”
</p><!--l. 12585--><p class="indent" >  “Hiding?”
</p><!--l. 12587--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah. She won&#x2019;t go out. She got accosted by a gang of Vietnamese with knives the
other day. She says they actually made her take oﬀ her top in the middle of Torgata,
and then got one of their girls in this posse to actually lick her tits! They were holding
her down. She thought they were going to rape her but they just left her there, with her
jacket and everything.”
</p><!--l. 12594--><p class="indent" >  “Shit. That&#x2019;s coz they all gay.”
</p><!--l. 12596--><p class="indent" >  “She&#x2019;s pretty badly shaken.”
</p><!--l. 12598--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ll bet. . .. . .damn. . ..I have to be careful here. There&#x2019;s fresh snow everywhere and
no base. And I&#x2019;m coming down the mountain. I&#x2019;m gonna fall and break my neck if
I&#x2019;m not careful.”
</p><!--l. 12602--><p class="indent" >  “The most dangerous part.”

</p><!--l. 12604--><p class="indent" >  They chant together: “More than half of all accidents happen on the way down!”
And they laugh.
</p><!--l. 12607--><p class="indent" >  “Seriously, this is going to take me a long time, and I won&#x2019;t get a decent rhythm to
charge from my boots, so I&#x2019;d better save power. Wait. . .”
</p><!--l. 12610--><p class="indent" >  She stops to plug her battery pack into her backpack lining. “As long as the sun is
out, I&#x2019;d better make the most of that.”
</p><!--l. 12613--><p class="indent" >  “Sure.”
</p><!--l. 12615--><p class="indent" >  “Wait, there&#x2019;s another call coming in, I&#x2019;d better take it and call back later.”
</p><!--l. 12618--><p class="indent" >  “Sure thing.”
</p><!--l. 12620--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah.”
</p><!--l. 12622--><p class="indent" >  “Bye bye.”
</p><!--l. 12624--><p class="indent" >  “See ya.” (Flip) “Hello?”
</p><!--l. 12626--><p class="indent" >  “Sara.” Older male voice, slightly hoarse.“This is Jonas Lindgren here. I&#x2019;m sorry to
call so early. Your mobile said you were available.We seem to have been
missing each other a lot lately, so I thought it was best to catch you while I
can..”
</p><!--l. 12631--><p class="indent" >  “Mr. Lindgren. Really. No kidding. I thought you&#x2019;d abandoned me.”
</p><!--l. 12633--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m sorry. I have a plate-full here.”
</p><!--l. 12635--><p class="indent" >  “Me too.”
</p><!--l. 12637--><p class="indent" >  “Are you okay? I just wanted to tell you that I am working on the money, so don&#x2019;t
worry about that. Just charge your expenses to the project and we&#x2019;ll sort it
out.”
</p><!--l. 12641--><p class="indent" >  “Glad you said that, since I already did.”
</p><!--l. 12643--><p class="indent" >  He laughs. “Good. So how is it going there? What is happening?”
</p><!--l. 12645--><p class="indent" >  “Ugh. Well, I am looking down from the top of a mountain that used to have the
American&#x2019;s main controller on it. Aliens seem to have stolen it or something,
because there is not a sign of it, and there has not been much of a sign of them
either.”
</p><!--l. 12650--><p class="indent" >  “Haven&#x2019;t you been working with them? I thought that was why you were going
there?”
</p><!--l. 12653--><p class="indent" >  “It was, but they have just literally disappeared oﬀ the face of the . . . Earth and they
seem to have taken their controller with them.”
</p><!--l. 12656--><p class="indent" >  “But, the bots?”
</p><!--l. 12658--><p class="indent" >  “Still here for the time being, but some of them are damaged. There&#x2019;s been some
excitement here with some neo-Nazi football-hooligans shooting each other and
everyone else up with paint-balls.”
</p><!--l. 12662--><p class="indent" >  “Jesus.”
</p><!--l. 12664--><p class="indent" >  “On a stick.”
</p><!--l. 12666--><p class="indent" >  “Where are they now?”
</p><!--l. 12668--><p class="indent" >  “Apparently the police have been rounding them up.”
</p><!--l. 12670--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s good.”
</p><!--l. 12672--><p class="indent" >  “They&#x2019;ve messed up some of the bots.”
</p><!--l. 12674--><p class="indent" >  “I see. So what are you doing out there?”

</p><!--l. 12676--><p class="indent" >  She stops on a boulder to concentrate a moment. “Well, I got a message to meet the
French team at the next cabin, and I&#x2019;m on my way there now. But I haven&#x2019;t had voice
contact for a long time. All I get is messages, notes. I took a little detour because I
wanted to see what was going on for myself.”
</p><!--l. 12682--><p class="indent" >  “That sounds peculiar.”
</p><!--l. 12684--><p class="indent" >  “No kidding. And the only person who answers is that Mrs. Laurent.”
</p><!--l. 12686--><p class="indent" >  “Laurent? I don&#x2019;t know her.”
</p><!--l. 12688--><p class="indent" >  “She&#x2019;s the one who&#x2019;s been answering my calls lately.”
</p><!--l. 12690--><p class="indent" >  ”Might be a sim? An answering service?”
</p><!--l. 12692--><p class="indent" >  Vibe shrugs with her mouth. “The last message I got was relayed over the
bots&#x2019; private network. That&#x2019;s a bit strange. I mean, the regular coverage is
okay.”
</p><!--l. 12696--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t know what that means.”
</p><!--l. 12698--><p class="indent" >  “Me neither.”
</p><!--l. 12700--><p class="indent" >  “Look, Sara, there&#x2019;s something else I need to tell you. You&#x2019;ll need to watch
yourself. Don&#x2019;t travel alone out there,.”
</p><!--l. 12703--><p class="indent" >  “Huh? I don&#x2019;t have much choice since the police sent everyone home. There&#x2019;s no
one else out here.”
</p><!--l. 12706--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I had a strange call yesterday, someone who knew about your project work
and thought he had discovered some kind of defence research. Some of the gangs have
been moving in on technologies lately and they found your thesis and misinterpreted
the title. From the call I got it sounds as though they might come looking for
you.”
</p><!--l. 12712--><p class="indent" >  “What?”
</p><!--l. 12714--><p class="indent" >  “It might be nothing. It might just be a crank call, but I think we should take it
seriously. I have notiﬁed the police. You should check in with them and report your
position. I&#x2019;m sending you a contact card.”
</p><!--l. 12719--><p class="indent" >  She feigns a laugh. “Heh – they are going to love me.”
</p><!--l. 12721--><p class="indent" >  “Why?”
</p><!--l. 12723--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I sort of snuck in here without permission, so they are probably already
looking for me to give me a good spanking.”
</p><!--l. 12726--><p class="indent" >  ”Well, even so. You can&#x2019;t think of that now. Check in. You don&#x2019;t want to get mixed
up in some gang thing. If there are gangs already up there, they might have
someone they can contact already. If they learn your position, you&#x2019;re an easy
target.”
</p><!--l. 12731--><p class="indent" >  “Great. So neo-Nazis are reading my thesis now? I suppose I should be
ﬂattered.”
</p><!--l. 12734--><p class="indent" >  Lindgren manages a laugh. “Not their thugs at least, but the police contact told me
that these gangs tend to work together, even though they like ﬁghting. It&#x2019;s all just a
game really. . .”
</p><!--l. 12738--><p class="indent" >  Speaking of that, Vibe thinks. I happen to know something about games.
</p><!--l. 12740--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s a bit hard to take seriously, ain&#x2019;t it?”

</p><!--l. 12742--><p class="indent" >  “These days anything can happen. I talked to this guy on the phone, and he was
pretty scary. I think you should be careful.”
</p><!--l. 12745--><p class="indent" >  “Okay.”
</p><!--l. 12747--><p class="indent" >  “Check in. Do it now, don&#x2019;t wait.”
</p><!--l. 12749--><p class="indent" >  “All right.”
</p><!--l. 12751--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m sending you a form, just click on it and it should send your position and so on.
You might want to add your destination too.”
</p><!--l. 12754--><p class="indent" >  “Is that a good idea? Think, if someone is listening!”
</p><!--l. 12756--><p class="indent" >  She hears a frown in his silence and pinches herself for involuntary irony. “The
form will go straight to them, signed and sealed.”
</p><!--l. 12759--><p class="indent" >  “So, look. I have to go now, but be careful out there and I hope you ﬁnd the French.
We are supposed to have a collaboration with them.”
</p><!--l. 12762--><p class="indent" >  “Right.”
</p><!--l. 12764--><p class="indent" >  “Be careful.”
</p><!--l. 12766--><p class="indent" >  “Thanks. Bye.”
</p><!--l. 12768--><p class="indent" >  “Bye.”
</p><!--l. 12770--><p class="indent" >  She considers telling him about her excitement at the behaviour of the
robots, but changes her mind. It can wait, until she is sure of what is going
on.
</p><!--l. 12774--><p class="indent" >  She stands there, looking at the form that Lindgren has sent her, on her wristband
wondering what she should do. If she sends it, they will ask her to return to a cabin
and stop what she is doing. That could be the end of what she is starting to learn here.
If there were only a little more time, she might have the answers she needs. She could
turn failure into success. On the other hand, she could wait just a little longer and give
herself a chance to think. There will be time on this trip, time to think. But there will
also be time if she sends it in, at least until she arrives as Leirvassbu. Then it will be
over.
</p><!--l. 12784--><p class="indent" >  Can she take the risk?
</p><!--l. 12786--><p class="indent" >  She needs to keep her options open.
</p><!--l. 12788--><p class="indent" >  Vibe surveys the panorama and breathes deeply of the icy fresh air. The sun is up.
There is optimism afoot.
</p><!--l. 12791--><p class="indent" >  One a penny, two a penny, three a penny more. . ..
</p><!--l. 12793--><p class="indent" >  She is on a roll. . .
</p><!--l. 12795--><p class="indent" >  Five a penny, six a penny, seven a penny.
</p><!--l. 12798--><p class="indent" >  Score.
</p><!--l. 12800--><p class="indent" >  She locks the input on her wrist band and grabs for her backpack.

<!--l. 12806--><p class="indent" >  The map on her wrist tells her that she can cut a corner and avoid going to the

base of the valley, where she would have to cross the river several times to
avoid marsh land. Snow is one thing, but wallowing in mud goes beyond
fun.
</p><!--l. 12811--><p class="indent" >  The higher she can walk, the thicker and more solid the snow will be. That makes it
easier to walk, as long as she does not hit a thin pocket and disappear up to her waist
in it, under the weight of her backpack.
</p><!--l. 12816--><p class="indent" >  It is diﬃcult to read the display on her mobile in bright sunlight. If she could be
bothered to stop, she would change it for a daylight Braille band, but she would rather
just get to where she is going.
</p><!--l. 12821--><p class="indent" >  Progress has been steady these hours of the morning and she feels that irrational
elation that comes from allowing a sunny day in the mountains to suﬀuse her
being. It has been too long since she came out here. How easy it is to suppose
oneself satisﬁed with lesser realities, more conveniently accessible from a
captive existence. Miles from anything man-made (barring her gadgets),
she can survey the handiwork of nature&#x2019;s slow sculpting and marvel at the
sensations.
</p><!--l. 12830--><p class="indent" >  The sweaty, jogging tramping over rock, snow and mud, can only be good for her
ﬁgure and surely her psyche too. The rhythmical meditation dislodges ideas and
thoughts that seemed to have become stuck in their own landscape. Walking is a ﬁne
way to plan her work. If she needs to, she can make voice notes for later, jotting down
ideas to follow up when she arrived as the cabin.
</p><!--l. 12837--><p class="indent" >  Before all of this started, she was trying to get the VeiVeks to all converge on a
point, without having a homing signal. The French were telling her that there was no
problem: they could just set up a homing signal or a satellite positioning system and
be done with, but that was missing the point. Out on Mars, they were not going to
have the power to set up a powerful homing beacon everywhere they went. Some
other technique would have to bring them in range of one another ﬁrst, before they
could aggregate. Also, if the individual agents discovered something of value that they
were investigating, that should be able to take priority of a central command
signal, at least until some Earth-bound human policy maker could override
it.
</p><!--l. 12849--><p class="indent" >  But the solution is simpler and more elegant than this brute force brainwashing. All
she needs is a simple message, like: <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Go West, young man! </span>It&#x2019;s practically like
advertising. The terrain will do the rest. A simple, hypnotic suggestion is all she
needs. She has seen the same thing in the game.
</p><!--l. 12855--><p class="indent" >  She and Bea have had their fun in leaving trails of breadcrumbs for the gamers to
follow, messing up their silly war simulations by appealing to their more primitive
needs. But they have also seen that the merest rumour planted into the network of
gamers can send them all on some quest for glory, each of them imagining that they
are the chosen one to do something diﬀerent. What if she could make such a
suggestion to these little bots? Kid gamers do not exhibit markedly more intelligence
than the VeiVeks, let&#x2019;s face it.
</p><!--l. 12864--><p class="indent" >  She is not sure if she can convince the rest of the team to test the idea. If she could

set up some kind of sim tonight, at the cabin, she might even be able to ﬁgure out how
to test it and change their minds. Going West is not going to be enough. Maybe that is
enough for Legendary Lemmings to throw themselves into the sea, but that is
not going to cut it for multi-millions dollar equipment. She has to try to do
better.
</p><!--l. 12872--><p class="indent" >  If she could only invent a kind of force that would herd them towards the spot, like
a ball rolling into the valley, she would not have to give them precise directions: they
would use their own skills to amplify her simple message and ﬁnd their own way.
Maybe she could even sell it to the Ministry of Transport as a way of solving traﬃc
congestion. Give the power to the cars.
</p><!--l. 12879--><p class="indent" >  She turns to look at the path she has followed. She can still make out the route
down the mountain and then past the corrie, up to this new hanging valley. It is not a
straightforward path, but her mobile has guided her and any information that is
available to her is also available to the VeiVeks. She has not exactly been taxing her
grey matter on this. They could do the same.
</p><!--l. 12886--><p class="indent" >  What she needs, to test her theory, is a simulation environment where she can
change the rules in real-time and model 3D. . .
</p><!--l. 12889--><p class="indent" >  An environment, like in the game.

<!--l. 12895--><p class="indent" >  Back in the days before she started at the College, Vibe used to play her clarinet
like the pied piper, making fun of her brother. He knew that she could always get her
way. When a young girl looks as good as she does, is smart and sexy and playful,
there is no male in the universe that can say no to her, especially if she discretely
ﬂashes some ﬂesh.
</p><!--l. 12902--><p class="indent" >  The trick is to do no wrong—no <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">real </span>wrong. She has tried her luck often enough at
bending the rules, but only in harmless fun. Gradually the small liberties have grown
into larger liberties. Perhaps one day she will end up stealing the Crown Jewels or
robbing Fort Knox and claiming that she was just having fun. Will her charm still
work then?
</p><!--l. 12909--><p class="indent" >  Mystery is the key. So many girls are just way too obvious, but Vibe knows that
there is power in keeping people guessing. She is never a pied piper, she is a fox and a
snake and a chameleon rolled into one, formless and adaptive. She knows how to read
people&#x2019;s signals and how to push their buttons. Being in control has been her life&#x2019;s
work.
</p><!--l. 12915--><p class="indent" >  But she has not always had everything she wanted. Peter Green is an itch that
she has been trying to scratch for as long as she can remember. It was just a
little more than she could deal with at the time, a feeling of having bitten oﬀ
more than she could chew. Nothing could be more humiliating than meeting

her match. She sees him now as something like a giant tarantula—a fear to
be faced and conquered. A last remaining fear to be faced? Or perhaps it
is better not to conquer all your fears. Perhaps one shouldn&#x2019;t become too
conﬁdent.
</p><!--l. 12924--><p class="indent" >  Her brother, Jan, still teases her with the accusation that she took a course in control
theory just to be certain that she would be one step ahead of the competition.
She is not certain whether or not he is right. She has always liked the rigour
of precision, like the music of Bach, but that was not enough. Greater than
the simple clockwork precision of a Bach composition is a symphony: a
symphony is like the weather tamed; it is a storm of cooperation, a whirlwind
of calculated concurrency. It is beauty from the collaboration of a skilled
swarm..
</p><!--l. 12933--><p class="indent" >  As a teenager, she studied Rimsky Korsakov&#x2019;s Principles of Orchestration, learning
about the basics of orchestrating music. His emphasis on understanding the individual
sounds and skills, combinations of instrumental timbres and projective powers has
been an inspiration in her work on collaborating agents. When one instrument loses
power of deﬁnition, you double it with another that adds a deﬁning edge. When one
agent struggles to perform its task, you supplement it with another with the
appropriate skill set. In that way, the symphony is carried eﬀortlessly along by its own
momentum.
</p><!--l. 12943--><p class="indent" >  The only part that she could not accept was the need for a conductor. The conductor
is necessary because the individual instruments do not have access to the full score –
only their own parts. When they are not playing, they do not know when
to start again without a signal from the controller. But Vibe knew that jazz
musicians manage just ﬁne without detailed instructions. Here, in the Hall of
the Mountain King, she has the idea of usurping power—girl power, and
becoming the queen of the individuals. She will be Scheherazade, saving the little
VeiVek autonomous agents from being virtually be-headed by a controller King
that waves its baton at the behest of stupid humans who cannot make up
their mind what they want. If there is pattern and structure to be found in
the collaboration of these individuals, then let it emerge spontaneously in a
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">jam</span>.
</p><!--l. 12957--><p class="indent" >  She wants to play jazz in these mountains, not Grieg.
</p><!--l. 12959--><p class="indent" >  And so she made it her business to study cooperation and emergence of society in
assemblies of individual agents. The VeiVekters. She would make them do more than
they were designed to be. She would be more than the state of the art. She would
make them able to work without their central manager, ready for the day when they

</p><!--l. 12966--><p class="indent" >  Well, it seemed like a nice fantasy.

class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Now who is that up there?</span>
</p><!--l. 12979--><p class="indent" >  Vibe strains to see through through the clear mountain air, without sunglasses.
Snow covers half the mountain here, even now. An icy wall hangs under the bluest of
skies, punctuated by rocky outcrops, where the melting has done its work. She is
nearing the valley and trees.
</p><!--l. 12984--><p class="indent" >  Running oﬀ into the distance she sees her footprints, muddied near the snow-line,
and fading into shadows as they lead away. A pink tinge of bacterial growth, stains the
melting of the older, wind-blown snow. And there, in the distance, there is someone
else, coming down behind her. Who could it be? Whoever it is, he or she
seems to be carrying no sack, no provisions. Why has she not seem him/her
before?
</p><!--l. 12991--><p class="indent" >  She winces at the pain in her heels. She is no longer sure whether the squidging
sensation is the blisters on her feet or the battery charging gel-packs in her
soles.
</p><!--l. 12995--><p class="indent" >  Well whoever it is, they are going to have to ﬁnd somewhere to stay soon. It is
getting late again. It will be getting cold soon, as the veiled sun falls into the shadow
of the mountains. Then they will be sorry they didn&#x2019;t follow the mountain
code.
</p><!--l. 13000--><p class="indent" >  Her own progress has been delayed by stopping at an auto-kiosk, for a
much needed breakfast, in the pleasant sunshine of the morning. Then she
spent a while checking out her little babies, while her mobile was playing
up. The new battery suddenly started to discharge, like the old one and she
had to switch the whole thing oﬀ in frustration. When she switched it on
again, there was a message about a possible fault or virus in the system. She
cursed and made sure to memorize the route to Leirvassbu in case anything
should happen. At the same time, she tried getting an auto-correction agent to
ﬁnd the problem and ﬁx it. That is going to use a lot of power in itself while
it runs, so eventually necessity moved her to charge; the charge of the lite
brigade.
</p><!--l. 13013--><p class="indent" >  Presumably he is travelling the same way. Maybe the travel warnings have been
rescinded fully now?
</p><!--l. 13016--><p class="indent" >  She switches on the radio, to check. Her battery can tolerate a little radio usage, and
besides: a little music wouldn&#x2019;t hurt for a while.
</p><!--l. 13019--><p class="indent" >  The radio stream opens with its greeting: “<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Welcome to OP3, entertainment around</span>
<span

</p><!--l. 13038--><p class="indent" >  The stream breaks into a pop song that is already half played-out.
</p><!--l. 13040--><p class="indent" >  Vibe stops for a moment to think. She had expected the gangs to be rounded up by
now. She checks for messages. Has Lindgren sent someone after her? Should she have
just send the form, as he asked her to?
</p><!--l. 13045--><p class="indent" >  She has only one message. A pink heart. It contains only one simple string, from
Bea:
</p><!--l. 13048--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Jason slept with Silje last night!!!!:)</span>
</p><!--l. 13050--><p class="indent" >  Her face widens to marvel at the concept, before discarding the message. She
reverses her tracks and recovers it for later. It might need some cycles of
attention.
</p><!--l. 13054--><p class="indent" >  On instinct, she tries the contact address for the American team. There is no reply
as usual. She tries the address for Mrs. Laurent and receives no reply, as usual. She
heaves a throaty sigh.
</p><!--l. 13058--><p class="indent" >  Vibe lets her backpack drop behind her and digs out her travel glasses from a top
pocket. She dons them and activates the smart map on her mobile. The world lights up
with information and advertising about backpacks, jackets and skis. It pleases her to
select a payment option for the advertising to go away. Such an intrusion is not
welcome at the moment. Now she must concentrate. She grabs the pack again and
heaves it into place. Better not waste any time.
</p><!--l. 13066--><p class="indent" >  She transfers the route she is following to the smart map and the path trail lights up
across the muddy, stoney hills ahead. Vibe pulls up her desktop in a discrete corner of
her vision; she leafs through the layers of her bookmarks and checks on her regular
items.
</p><!--l. 13071--><p class="indent" >  The VeiVeks are on the move, still congregating around a small number of cabins.
Their status monitors show that they are now responding to speciﬁc instructions that
have been spread among them: instructions to home in on particular coordinates. That
means that someone is telling them to do so, which means that the American team is
out there but not talking to her. Damn them. What kind of collaboration is
this?
</p><!--l. 13079--><p class="indent" >  She pulls up her contact list, looking for an embassy contact for the French team,
almost stumbling as she fails to concentrate on the path, and dials them on impulse.
She expects to hear a ringing tone that remains unanswered, but this time she is
redirected to a message immediately. Nothing from the French embassy at all. She
tries the Americans.

</p><!--l. 13085--><p class="indent" >  “This is a message from the American embassy. Voice communication with
American government oﬃcials and American nationals employed by the embassy is
currently suspended under anti-terrorist legislation. Please try later or send your
message as a signed text object.”
</p><!--l. 13090--><p class="indent" >  In frustration, she encapsulates the response and forwards the whole thing to Jonas
Lindgren with a voice addendum:
</p><!--l. 13093--><p class="indent" >  “Mr. Lindgren, can you ﬁnd out what is going on? I am going crazy here. They are
messing up my experiment now, and they are not talking.”
</p><!--l. 13097--><p class="indent" >  Then she adds. “I could just override the VeiVeks. I mean, we wrote the
software. The hardware is theirs, but the software is ours. Who owns them
anyway?”
</p><!--l. 13101--><p class="indent" >  “We could just remove the speciﬁc instruction and let them decide. . . I
mean, we would only be freeing them—bringing the message of freedom
to their little world. Isn&#x2019;t that American policy? They would support us. .
.”
</p><!--l. 13106--><p class="indent" >  If she were feeling more destructive, it would be so easy to program the little robots
to bury each other in noise: tell them all to babble, to use up one another&#x2019;s&#x2019;
processing power so much with irrelevant chit-chat that no serious message
would be processed. A bit like subscribing to a tabloid newspaper. That would
be sort of suicidal, but it might be a satisfying revenge, if it ever comes to
that.
</p><!--l. 13114--><p class="indent" >  A sharp crack sounds somewhere in the distance. She turns to look. Her companion
is still there. Who ever it is, he is running now. That&#x2019;s not a great idea given the
terrain. Why would anyone. . .
</p><!--l. 13118--><p class="indent" >  A chill ﬂoods her aching soma.
</p><!--l. 13120--><p class="indent" >  There are several possibilities as to who the ﬁgure could be. None of them seem
very promising.
</p><!--l. 13123--><p class="indent" >  But why would anyone be running towards her? Why would they care about her?
Unless, what Dr Lindgren said about seeking her out could be true. Unless someone
was looking speciﬁcally for her. In which case running is not a good sign. Perhaps she
should be running.
</p><!--l. 13128--><p class="indent" >  She increases her walking speed somewhat. She should make it to the
Leirvassbu cabin within an hour or so, but it does not harm to get there a
little sooner. All she really wants at this point is a hot shower and a good
meal.
</p><!--l. 13133--><p class="indent" >  She texts Bea: <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">You there?</span>.
</p><!--l. 13135--><p class="indent" >  The ping comes back to say that Bea is busy and misery compounds her
uncertainty. She feels alone again. Why will no one talk to her? It seems like hours
since she saw or heard from anyone she is close to. She feels stranded, stuck in the
middle of nowhere, and now someone is behind her, perhaps even following
her.
</p><!--l. 13141--><p class="indent" >  It could be someone chasing her. It could be a gang member that will harass
her.

</p><!--l. 13144--><p class="indent" >  And all she wants is to rest.
</p><!--l. 13146--><p class="indent" >  Suddenly she ﬁnds her self running, spooked either by the sound or by her own
ruminations. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">My god</span>, she thinks, <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">what is going on here? </span>Why on Earth would anyone
be chasing her here?
</p><!--l. 13150--><p class="indent" >  She follows the yellow brick road path in her glasses. Now that she has descended
well below the snow line, the hills are covered in bushes, wet and the path is muddy. It
feels colder again. She reaches the bottom of a depression, snagging her sack on
some branches, and crosses a tiny brook and the path begins to wind upwards
again.
</p><!--l. 13156--><p class="indent" >  The rocky landscape is hard underfoot. There are brambles and bushes here now, at
this lower altitude, even some smaller trees. There is shallow and windblown snow
above her, but the earth beneath her make the pounding of walking shoes—even her
lightweight, summer boots — hard on her feet. It is a gradual climb to the top of the
hill, then she is running, almost sliding down the steep descent, kicking mud and
small stones down with her. Her knees are sore and muscles, just above, are burning
with the exertion. Her backpack is ﬂailing all over the place. It was not designed for
running.
</p><!--l. 13166--><p class="indent" >  It ought to be a good thing—to shed some of that winter fat, she thinks in spite
of the adrenalin blindness. But to hell with all that. She just wants to rest.
Misery begins to brew a bath of negativity, which douses her with its cold
aches.
</p><!--l. 13171--><p class="indent" >  She stumbles on. Breath rushes in and out of cavernous lungs, surely larger for
yesterday&#x2019;s endeavour, passing through the raw constrictions of her nose and mouth. It
has a certain taste; a metallic taste.
</p><!--l. 13176--><p class="indent" >  Then suddenly, up ahead, she sees another ﬁgure, probably a man, talking into a
mobile and looking her way. He sees her and starts walking towards her, still talking
on the fone. She stops abruptly. This is the only path forward and she is stuck in
between the two of them. Suddenly she is frightened, actually fearful. What
could happen to her out here? There is not a sign of anyone else here, and she
has not brought any kind of defensive weapon with her. There&#x2019;s no one to
call.
</p><!--l. 13184--><p class="indent" >  She looks around her. She cannot see her pursuer from behind, and the man up
ahead has holstered his handset and is walking down into the valley, which she must
cross, if she is to pass him. She looks about her frantically. On the left there is only a
slow climb to the summit of the fern-covered hill, beyond that, a somewhat
steeper climb up a rocky outcrop. To the right, it is a steep descent down an
embankment shrouded in trees and thick vegetation, towards the river valley. It is a
dangerous, and not exactly easy route to take, but she appears to have little
choice.
</p><!--l. 13194--><p class="indent" >  She tightens the waist belt of her backpack and descends carefully down the
forty-ﬁve degree slope to the valley below, sideways, pushing aside birch scraping
brambles, holding herself ﬁrmly to the trunks, to slow her descent. She might
disappear in here, but if they ever found her, she would be stuck.

</p><!--l. 13200--><p class="indent" >  At least she has a head start. It will take the closest of them a good ﬁfteen minutes
to get down into the little depression and to climb up the other side again. Hopefully,
he did not see her come down here.
</p><!--l. 13204--><p class="indent" >  Progress is slow and clumsy. This is not going fast enough.
</p><!--l. 13206--><p class="indent" >  He&#x2019;ll be here soon.
</p><!--l. 13208--><p class="indent" >  She feels cold again.
</p><!--l. 13210--><p class="indent" >  As a last minute consideration, she pauses to select the message that Lindgren sent
her earlier. It reveals the form that she was supposed to send to the police. It&#x2019;s still
there, waiting for her to press send. It ﬁlls itself out. She does not need to do anything
except press the button.
</p><!--l. 13216--><p class="indent" >  She stares at it, uncertain as to what she should do. Why couldn&#x2019;t she just have
stayed put when they told her to? Now she is actually in trouble.
</p><!--l. 13220--><p class="indent" >  Vibe, the invincible.
</p><!--l. 13222--><p class="indent" >  It isn&#x2019;t right.
</p><!--l. 13224--><p class="indent" >  Fuck.
</p><!--l. 13226--><p class="indent" >  She might as well press the button. She shudders slightly at being pushed into a
corner. Que sera sera. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I should just do it.</span>
</p><!--l. 13229--><p class="indent" >  Vibe tries to jump down from her present position to a large boulder, lodged at the
root of the next tree. The boulder is not as solid as it appears. It rocks and tumbles out
of its socket, talking her with it. She falls on her side, scraping her hip beneath her
trouser leg, and slides down the wet earth on what must be the only clear channel
through this increasingly thick jungle.
</p><!--l. 13236--><p class="indent" >  As she slides, out of control. she sees the edge of the world approaching, but her
body is too taught with fear to react. Time slows, with increasing burden of passage;
her mind accelerates to focus on every detail of her undoing. She manages to grab a
branch to arrest her motion. The breaking rips the branch through cold ﬁngers with a
searing pain, but drags her onto her side and she stops, teetering on an unknown
brink.
</p><!--l. 13244--><p class="indent" >  Hanging, half over the edge of something she cannot see, from her lying position,
with just her upper body on the muddy stone ledge, she groans. The backpack is too
heavy for her to roll onto her stomach easily, and she needs both hands to hang onto
the branch. If she wriggles, the branch could tear and she would fall for certain, but
lying like this on her side, she cannot ﬁnd and purchase with her legs. She is trapped
in this position, and she will remain like this until her hands tire, or the branch
breaks.
</p><!--l. 13253--><p class="indent" >  “Help,” she whispers.

</p><!--l. 13312--><p class="indent" >  “Tea?” someone asks her.
</p><!--l. 13314--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, please.”
</p><!--l. 13316--><p class="indent" >  The young man looks at her peculiarly. “You don&#x2019;t need to say please here,” he
laughs,
</p><!--l. 13319--><p class="indent" >  “Sorry.”
</p><!--l. 13321--><p class="indent" >  “No, no, never mind. You want rose hip or Earl Grey?”

</p><!--l. 13327--><p class="indent" >  “Tea?”
</p><!--l. 13329--><p class="indent" >  “Oh, is that some kind of special tea? We only have ordinary Earl Grey.”

</p><!--l. 13331--><p class="indent" >  Her face cannot conceal its scepticism. “Earl Grey is ordinary?”
</p><!--l. 13333--><p class="indent" >  “Isn&#x2019;t it?”
</p><!--l. 13335--><p class="indent" >  “Could I have some water?”

pew and get started.”
</p><!--l. 13346--><p class="indent" >  Shuﬄing bodies accrete at the oval table in the little meeting room, birch-wood
with woven cushions. Very Scandinavian. Preeta is surprised that, so deep into the
heart of the central police authority, no one is wearing a uniform. Correction, one
uniform enters, nodding a greeting.
</p><!--l. 13351--><p class="indent" >  Bishop clasps his hands at the head of the oval.
</p><!--l. 13353--><p class="indent" >  “All right, Good Morning. Most of you know Preeta by now. For those of you who
don&#x2019;t, she has been here for a few days now and will stay for at least a few weeks. We
have ‘borrowed her&#x2019; from the game&#x2019;s outsourced diagnostic team in Malaysia.
Welcome, Preeta, to our little working group.”
</p><!--l. 13359--><p class="indent" >  A wave of nods and acknowledgements cycles around the table. She nods
reservedly back.
</p><!--l. 13362--><p class="indent" >  The faces span several generations, she observes. She is amongst the youngest of
the group, but two other faces also seem young: one male, one female.
</p><!--l. 13366--><p class="indent" >  “What we do here is varied, but important.”
</p><!--l. 13368--><p class="indent" >  “What we do is to drink coﬀee and read the papers,” someone says.

</p><!--l. 13372--><p class="indent" >  “Sometimes we play games.”
</p><!--l. 13374--><p class="indent" >  There is laughter around the table, more like sniggering.
</p><!--l. 13376--><p class="indent" >  “All right,” Bishop says, patiently. “Our primary mandate is to ensure that the
police forces of the world all have a job in the next ten years. It&#x2019;s getting harder for
everyone to enforce laws, society is changing, and we have been assembled to look at
strategies for the future of policing. In that connection, we are studying things like the
psychological warfare techniques being used by the United States in their virtual
reality game.”
</p><!--l. 13384--><p class="indent" >  “Batman to the rescue.”
</p><!--l. 13386--><p class="indent" >  “So why don&#x2019;t we go around the table and say who we are and what we do?
Jonathan, do you want to start?”
</p><!--l. 13390--><p class="indent" >  Jonathan, a medium height, medium build, medium blond man, somewhere
between twenty-ﬁve and thirty years old. “Uhm. Okay. I am Jonathan Moen. I&#x2019;ve
been here for about six months. Finished Police College and have a degree in
computational sociology. I am working on the forensic patterns in VR sims.” He
shrugs and looks to the next man.
</p><!--l. 13396--><p class="indent" >  “Jonathan comes to us with an excellent background from academia. He has been
pretty central to our eﬀorts to integrate proactive campaigns into policing. We are
lucky to have people with top schooling among us.”

</p><!--l. 13400--><p class="indent" >  Jonathan keeps a stoney face, but Preeta sees from his eye movements that he is
blushing on the inside.
</p><!--l. 13403--><p class="indent" >  “Ivar?”
</p><!--l. 13405--><p class="indent" >  “Ivar Jensen. I am doing research on the propaganda engine in the game. I guess
we&#x2019;ll have a lot to talk about.” He is ﬂabby, overweight.
</p><!--l. 13408--><p class="indent" >  Preeta nods a smile.
</p><!--l. 13410--><p class="indent" >  “Was that it? Ivar?” The young woman at the table laughs in disbelief.
</p><!--l. 13412--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m a man of few words.”
</p><!--l. 13414--><p class="indent" >  “And few manners”
</p><!--l. 13416--><p class="indent" >  “You&#x2019;re welcome!”
</p><!--l. 13418--><p class="indent" >  “Keep going,” Bishop injects with studied patience.
</p><!--l. 13420--><p class="indent" >  “Hi I am Nina. Not The Nina. . .”
</p><!--l. 13422--><p class="indent" >  The others laugh.
</p><!--l. 13424--><p class="indent" >  Jonathan explains: “As in Nina Hagen.”
</p><!--l. 13426--><p class="indent" >  “Our glorious leader, the ice queen.”
</p><!--l. 13428--><p class="indent" >  “Nina! Pretty ballerina!”
</p><!--l. 13430--><p class="indent" >  “She is the head of our international police division.”
</p><!--l. 13432--><p class="indent" >  “No that is not me. I am just Nina. I&#x2019;m a masters student at Police College. Just
starting really. I am going to be studying the use of symbolism in the visual slogans
and imagery used in electronic gaming. I&#x2019;m hoping to ﬁnd out how eﬀective the
diﬀerent images are, compared to a study that was made ten yeas ago. The idea is to
see how much society has changed.”
</p><!--l. 13439--><p class="indent" >  Preeta chances a comment. “You mean here in Norway?”
</p><!--l. 13441--><p class="indent" >  The question is repeated in expectant looks from the table.
</p><!--l. 13443--><p class="indent" >  “We haven&#x2019;t ﬁgured that out yet,” she replies. “It depends where we can get data
from. The earlier study we have is from the United Kingdom. It would be
best to repeat it in the same place. If not it will have to be a comparative
study,”
</p><!--l. 13448--><p class="indent" >  Preeta nods in interest. Like everyone else here, she would like to know the
answer.
</p><!--l. 13451--><p class="indent" >  The door opens and a youngish man with short reddish hair and heavy outdoor
clothing bustles in. Eyes turn to inspect his non-descript form. He is neither tidy nor
shabby, but somehow he looks a mess. The next one around the table is wondering
whether the baton has been passed.
</p><!--l. 13457--><p class="indent" >  “Sorry I&#x2019;m late,” he says.
</p><!--l. 13459--><p class="indent" >  “Take a seat and you can join the parade,” Bishop pipes. “We are just going around
the table introducing ourselves. And, as long as you&#x2019;re here, it looks like its your
turn.”
</p><!--l. 13463--><p class="indent" >  Like a deer caught in the headlights, Dermot displays panic and disorientation for a
second, then: “Uh okay.”
</p><!--l. 13466--><p class="indent" >  Dermot seats himself and pulls his shoulder back oﬀ his bulky anorak, taking up
more space and time than he needs to. He does not unzip the bulky jacket, but looks
around the table. “I&#x2019;m Dermot,” he says. He sits there like a polar explorer who just

dropped in for tea.
</p><!--l. 13471--><p class="indent" >  The others snigger. “Mr. Pizza.”
</p><!--l. 13473--><p class="indent" >  Bishop remarks, “Dermot is on loan to us from the big gaming company, here in
Oslo. He is one of the game experts. You two will have a bit in common. He is the one
who implemented your algorithm for us, and we are bringing him into the fold in our
research.”
</p><!--l. 13478--><p class="indent" >  Dermot looks bemused, or perhaps simply uneasy at being the centre of
attention.
</p><!--l. 13481--><p class="indent" >  “Is this. . .?”
</p><!--l. 13483--><p class="indent" >  “This is Preeta Dhawan, from the outsourcing in Malaysia.”
</p><!--l. 13485--><p class="indent" >  “Hello,” he tries.
</p><!--l. 13487--><p class="indent" >  “Hello.”
</p><!--l. 13489--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ve – eh, heard you were coming. . .eh. . .”
</p><!--l. 13491--><p class="indent" >  “All right, let&#x2019;s keep going.”
</p><!--l. 13493--><p class="indent" >  “Keep going.”
</p><!--l. 13495--><p class="indent" >  Next man, an older greying man with sun-damaged skin; the only man with a
uniform: “My name is Art. Art Haugen. I am the liason with the foot-soldiers in the
ﬁeld. My job is to make sure these thinkers keep their feet on the ground and deliver
solutions to the men and women in blue.”
</p><!--l. 13501--><p class="indent" >  “Art is an important member of the group. . .”
</p><!--l. 13503--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I&#x2019;m not really a part of the group, but I can still get past the bouncers. .
.”
</p><!--l. 13505--><p class="indent" >  “We need people to keep us in touch, and to take us out into the ﬁeld. Art can call
upon us to help with speciﬁc cases if the regular police need assistance. It doesn&#x2019;t
happen too often, but sometimes. . .”
</p><!--l. 13509--><p class="indent" >  Art interrupts: “Ed, can I just ask a practical detail?”
</p><!--l. 13511--><p class="indent" >  “Go ahead.”
</p><!--l. 13513--><p class="indent" >  “If Preeta is going to be working here temporarily, what security clearance is she
going to have? We need to ﬁgure this out if we are going to be involving her with
operations.”
</p><!--l. 13517--><p class="indent" >  Preeta&#x2019;s eyes morph, visibly increasing in their intensity.
</p><!--l. 13519--><p class="indent" >  “We&#x2019;ll be discussing that later. Essentially, she will have full clearance for game
related projects. She already knows as much as we do. Anything else would be
senseless.”
</p><!--l. 13523--><p class="indent" >  “All right.”
</p><!--l. 13525--><p class="indent" >  Talking in general, “Preeta has been working for the main outsource diagnostic ﬁrm
in Malaysia. She also happens to be an expert on the new tools that I presented to you
last month. We have been sharing notes with her for some time, in the developers&#x2019;
fora. We have also been talking about bringing her to the U.S. We&#x2019;re arranging cover
at Dermot&#x2019;s ﬁrm.”
</p><!--l. 13532--><p class="indent" >  “That doesn&#x2019;t sound like a good idea.”
</p><!--l. 13534--><p class="indent" >  “What happened now was that she was identiﬁed as a target and we had to evacuate
her. The mob has started moving in on the game since the hoo-hah in the press about it

recently. They&#x2019;ve been falling behind and they have apparently identiﬁed Asia as
the place to start getting their foot in the door. Preeta thinks they have been
staking out her company for some time, and that they have singled her out for
coercion, for whatever reason. She is a key diagnostician, young, single, female. .
.”
</p><!--l. 13542--><p class="indent" >  “So what happens now?”
</p><!--l. 13544--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah, won&#x2019;t they simply move on to someone else?”
</p><!--l. 13546--><p class="indent" >  Preeta feels a cold dagger slice through her stomach.
</p><!--l. 13548--><p class="indent" >  “Probably, but they won&#x2019;t get as far as fast without Preeta. That gives us a chance to
. . . nip this in the bud, before it gets out of hand. I&#x2019;ve already been in touch with
Interpol in Asia. We are working together on this, and they are looking over Preeta&#x2019;s
company.”
</p><!--l. 13553--><p class="indent" >  “Stake out.”
</p><!--l. 13555--><p class="indent" >  “Nikita.”
</p><!--l. 13557--><p class="indent" >  Preeta tries to smile, though the humour is not really her cup of rose-hip tea. They
seem a little like children to her, except for Bishop. He seems like a person of
authority—not forced authority, like a military man, but a man of natural authority. He
is someone she can respect. Then there is the late-comer, who is just quiet. He seems
like someone she could be around.
</p><!--l. 13564--><p class="indent" >  “So, let&#x2019;s ﬁnish the introductions. Alex?”
</p><!--l. 13566--><p class="indent" >  The last, stocky young man stammers his reply. “Alexander. Alex. Flow
analyst.”
</p><!--l. 13568--><p class="indent" >  “Meaning that this young man is an intelligence coordinator. He works partly with
the defence department. Part of our ﬁnding comes from them.”
</p><!--l. 13571--><p class="indent" >  “I. . .I. . .just want to say welcome,” he adds. “I think we are lucky to have you. I
know that Preeta is actually one of the best people in sim diagnosis.”
</p><!--l. 13574--><p class="indent" >  “Thank you very much, you are very kind. . .”
</p><!--l. 13576--><p class="indent" >  “Preeta, you have to learn one thing. We don&#x2019;t say thank you all the time here. .
.”
</p><!--l. 13578--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s enough,” Bishop jabs. “It&#x2019;s about time we had some manners in here. Let
me apologize for our rudeness.”
</p><!--l. 13581--><p class="indent" >  She shakes her head, trying to tuck her chin and recede back into her long dark
hair.
</p><!--l. 13584--><p class="indent" >  “So tell us, do people in Malaysia blame America for what is going on?”
</p><!--l. 13586--><p class="indent" >  “Ivar, do you have to. . ..”
</p><!--l. 13588--><p class="indent" >  “No, it&#x2019;s a fair question. It&#x2019;s relevant. . .”
</p><!--l. 13590--><p class="indent" >  “Well, the question is a loaded question. How can you answer it now without either
being defensive or feeling obligated to agree?”
</p><!--l. 13593--><p class="indent" >  “Obliged to agree.”
</p><!--l. 13595--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s what I said.”
</p><!--l. 13597--><p class="indent" >  “You said obligated.”
</p><!--l. 13599--><p class="indent" >  “So, what&#x2019;s your point?”
</p><!--l. 13601--><p class="indent" >  “Boys! Are you going to let her answer? If you ask a question. . .”

</p><!--l. 13603--><p class="indent" >  “Would you like to answer, Preeta. . .?”
</p><!--l. 13605--><p class="indent" >  Her face leaks a betrayal of indecision and reticence. “I am not sure I know what
you are asking.”
</p><!--l. 13608--><p class="indent" >  “America is a superpower. They have been driving this technological, every
conglomerate for itself politics for some time. They have been telling us all about
morality and then they forgot to observe it themselves.”
</p><!--l. 13612--><p class="indent" >  “Well. Her generation has seen it coming for some time,” Bishop adds. “The
Americans are the last remaining superpower <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">because </span>they won a propaganda war, not
because they were morally superior. Now other countries have been following
suit. Today it is candid information warfare. Everything happens behind the
scenes.”
</p><!--l. 13618--><p class="indent" >  “American is not the place where society is breaking up as much as in other place,”
Preeta inserts, more conﬁdently now. “It is here and in Japan, Korea, Russia and the
former soviet states – where people are reserved. That is where the mobile gaming has
made people isolate themselves.”
</p><!--l. 13624--><p class="indent" >  “She&#x2019;s right. America is suﬀering civil disorder because of the formation of
gangs and mobs. Its about challenging the government, not about retreating
from it. If there&#x2019;s one thing the Americans are good at it&#x2019;s talking to each
other.”
</p><!--l. 13629--><p class="indent" >  “So we are to blame for the collapse of society. That&#x2019;s a comforting thought.”
</p><!--l. 13631--><p class="indent" >  “What makes you think we ever had one?” Dermot quips.
</p><!--l. 13633--><p class="indent" >  “But it&#x2019;s still the same thing. De-centralization of power is the result, and it comes
about because people feel empowered by all these devices that allow them to
manipulate pretty much anything they want from wherever they are. . . What do you
need authority for?”
</p><!--l. 13638--><p class="indent" >  “All right, let&#x2019;s focus a minute,” Bishop sounds. “The aim of this meeting was to let
us all meet one another and to maybe hear some ideas about the problems that we are
seeing, and how we are going to make use of Preeta&#x2019;s skills while she is
here.”
</p><!--l. 13643--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, down to business.”
</p><!--l. 13645--><p class="indent" >  “Good. Our group&#x2019;s long term goal is to look at ways of restoring a respect for law
and order by using the same techniques for suggestion as the gaming engine. We are
trying to sell people the idea of society again. Buy back what gave you what you now
have.”
</p><!--l. 13650--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah, it&#x2019;s like saving the rain forests.”
</p><!--l. 13652--><p class="indent" >  “But Preeta, here, has been telling me for some time that the methods used in the
game are doomed to failure. Can you tell us a little more?”
</p><!--l. 13655--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ll try. . .”
</p><!--l. 13657--><p class="indent" >  Ivar interjects: “We are looking for ways of doing two things: counter-propaganda
for law enforcement. Ways of tracing cause and eﬀect for forensic analysis.”
</p><!--l. 13661--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, we are working with a group in Spain that has some special expertise there.
We have seen that it is possible to disrupt the directed messages in the game
so that they are eﬀectively useless. Someone has been doing it a lot lately.

We are not sure whether they are doing it on purpose, or whether it is an
accident.”
</p><!--l. 13667--><p class="indent" >  “It doesn&#x2019;t matter,” Preeta says. “It will happen anyway.”
</p><!--l. 13669--><p class="indent" >  The others look at her, in surprise.
</p><!--l. 13671--><p class="indent" >  “Interesting that you say that. I know that you have been talking about this for some
time. But for us, this is a new idea.”
</p><!--l. 13675--><p class="indent" >  “We just mentioned it the other day.”
</p><!--l. 13677--><p class="indent" >  “The messages cannot work because there are just too many of them. Not only is it
too hard to absorb all of the messages, the software has a ﬂaw in it&#x2019; which limits the
amount of hashing space for template expansion.”
</p><!--l. 13681--><p class="indent" >  “Gesundheit!”
</p><!--l. 13683--><p class="indent" >  “Uhm. If you are not a programmer, it has to do with the way the directed messages
are rendered in the backgrounds and surfaces. Some of the messages are crashing or
getting mixed up because of the way the authorization checks are implemented. .
.”
</p><!--l. 13688--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ve seen that,” Dermot says.
</p><!--l. 13690--><p class="indent" >  “And you probably know what she&#x2019;s talking about too.”
</p><!--l. 13692--><p class="indent" >  “Yes I do.”
</p><!--l. 13694--><p class="indent" >  She experiences a glow of satisfaction at having marked her territory.
</p><!--l. 13696--><p class="indent" >  She continues. “The game designers have tried to add the authorization stuﬀ in at a
level where they can use it to essentially block any messages they don&#x2019;t want to get
through and pass ones that they do, but the lack of hashing space means that the
messages are just getting mixed up or corrupted because of this intervention. They are
colliding.”
</p><!--l. 13702--><p class="indent" >  “Can&#x2019;t they just increase the space?”
</p><!--l. 13704--><p class="indent" >  She shakes her head. “It&#x2019;s not that simple. It has knock-on consequences. They have
essentially reached a limit in the current resources. It will take a long time to
ﬁx.”
</p><!--l. 13707--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, and the hashing space is distributed. It&#x2019;s not like it&#x2019;s all in one place and you
can just add more – it is in multiple versions of software running on hardware in a
dozen countries. . .if you start changing things in one place, you have to change them
everywhere, or at least have a strategy for assuring compatability with previous
versions.”
</p><!--l. 13713--><p class="indent" >  “So there is no quick-ﬁx.”
</p><!--l. 13715--><p class="indent" >  “Instead of controlling the messages, they are actually corrupting them?”
</p><!--l. 13717--><p class="indent" >  “Something like that.”
</p><!--l. 13719--><p class="indent" >  “I have talked to the group in San Diego, and they are trying to make out that this is
an administrative error, but I think that, if you look at the code, you have to see that
this is a deliberate attempt to add a veto and replacement message. It&#x2019;s very cryptic,
but I have done an analysis.”
</p><!--l. 13725--><p class="indent" >  “The eﬀect is that the centralized control is lost and all of the messages and
sims are fragmenting themselves, just like what we see happening in the real
world.”

</p><!--l. 13729--><p class="indent" >  “And yet the game has not yet fallen apart.”
</p><!--l. 13731--><p class="indent" >  “Nor has society, thankfully.”
</p><!--l. 13733--><p class="indent" >  “We should bear in mind that the recent interest by the gangs is going to mean more
trouble for us.”
</p><!--l. 13736--><p class="indent" >  “Why would we be in danger?”
</p><!--l. 13738--><p class="indent" >  “They could try to kill you.”
</p><!--l. 13740--><p class="indent" >  Preeta starts. Since the incident in KL, she has often placed her hands inside her
pants and just held on, remembering the invasion.
</p><!--l. 13744--><p class="indent" >  “Let&#x2019;s not get over excited here,” Art interrupts. “What we do know is that some of
the hooligan gangs attached to neo-Nazi wings have attached themselves to football
colours and are using their maﬁa contacts to get involved in more meaningful
attacks.”
</p><!--l. 13749--><p class="indent" >  “You mean they have become hired thugs?”
</p><!--l. 13751--><p class="indent" >  “Exactly right, but they are also game junkies. We have an operation on going now
to break up a war-game in Jotunheimen. . .”
</p><!--l. 13754--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s the mountains here in Norway..”
</p><!--l. 13756--><p class="indent" >  “. . .As long as they are on the loose with their own propaganda ﬂowing freely. .
.”
</p><!--l. 13758--><p class="indent" >  “. . .by ﬁst. . .”
</p><!--l. 13761--><p class="indent" >  “. . .no one can think of themselves as being safe. It is obviously a time of
year where they come out of the woodwork. There&#x2019;s been a lot of activity
lately.”
</p><!--l. 13764--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah. . .” Dermot recalls his encounter and feels ill.
</p><!--l. 13766--><p class="indent" >  “So the upshot is that all of these messages are having a real eﬀect on what is going
on out there, and that means we cannot discount the possibility of the kind of thing
that Preeta has experienced coming here to Oslo.”
</p><!--l. 13770--><p class="indent" >  “I expect that makes her feel a lot better.”
</p><!--l. 13772--><p class="indent" >  “Well, at least she is with people who can protect her, and who can make use of her
skills,” Art puts.
</p><!--l. 13775--><p class="indent" >  “Yes,” Bishop adds, “While Preeta is here, I want you to make the most of her
knowledge and her skills. We need to test out our own ideas.”
</p><!--l. 13779--><p class="indent" >  She senses a thrill. No one has really referred to her skills before.
</p><!--l. 13782--><p class="indent" >  As the meeting simply falls into disarray, a couple of members of the little group
focus increasingly on Preeta, digging for facts about her. Others simply fade out and
try to ignore her presence, as though they are shunning her, or perhaps are
simply in-equipped to deal with new acquaintances, with no common frame of
reference.
</p><!--l. 13788--><p class="indent" >  They begin to ﬁddle with their mobile gadgets, hooking in to some private world, as
if blowing smoke in her face; that is what they would have done in India. In this
country, she has seen people using their mobile devices frequently as protective garbs
and defensive ploys. It is easy to see why this, of all places, would be in need of a
smart police force, savvy in the ways of bringing people back to a sense of civic
responsibility. She has not been here more than a handful of days, but already she has

seen how this society is fragmented into little labelled pieces. Kids in little
groups, talking to their remote friends as they walk down the middle of a
street.
</p><!--l. 13799--><p class="indent" >  Light ﬂakes of snow are falling in the grey haze outside. They melt as they meet the
window. It oﬀers a serenity, a quiet sleepiness.
</p><!--l. 13804--><p class="indent" >  “They have tried to be too ambitious. By trying to tie every game and simulation
into a single framework, they have introduces inconsistencies. you just cannot force an
entire world to conform, even when you own the platform. Remember what happened
to Microsoft.”
</p><!--l. 13812--><p class="indent" >  She has never been a shy person, but something about this dislocation has made her
reticent.
</p><!--l. 13815--><p class="indent" >  “So what&#x2019;s it like in Malaysia?”
</p><!--l. 13817--><p class="indent" >  She shrugs. “The same. Diﬀerent.”
</p><!--l. 13819--><p class="indent" >  “We could go into the VR to chat?”
</p><!--l. 13821--><p class="indent" >  Bishop intervenes. “No. Stay here. Face up to it.”
</p><!--l. 13827--><p class="indent" >  “But I could see that it was not going to work. I was doing my job as I
was supposed to. I just wanted to do my best, as an analyst. We get these
speciﬁcations that we are supposed to follow. I think they looked okay from
a design point of view, but we have tools that perform fancy analyses. It&#x2019;s
something i have been playing with in my spare time, to kind of secure my
future.”
</p><!--l. 13834--><p class="indent" >  “But it was a good thing that we found you. The secret is out already. Nothing
anyone could do about that. And it was just a matter of time, no big surprises
there. Of course, originally no one thought that anyone would be able to
ﬁgure out what is really going on in such a huge enterprise, nor be able to do
anything about it even if they could. But then this story was leaked to the
free press, and even the Americans had to print it eventually. You can&#x2019;t stop
the ﬂow of news. That was when they arranged to whitewash conference in
California. They are nervous now and that means they are getting to be more
dangerous.”
</p><!--l. 13845--><p class="indent" >  “Why don&#x2019;t they just move to an island somewhere?”
</p><!--l. 13847--><p class="indent" >  “Eventually all this will be done on oﬀ-shore ships, but international law is also
changing slowly to clamp down on pirate communities.”
</p><!--l. 13853--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t worry about your friends. We have Interpol on surveillance of the company.
They will inform your old boss that you are helping us with our enquiries, as they
say.”
</p><!--l. 13857--><p class="indent" >  Her gaze wanders around the modern interior and wooden kitchen units. through
the windows, the world is brightening. It seems almost as though the sun would
shine.
</p><!--l. 13864--><p class="indent" >  “Something has come up.”
</p><!--l. 13867--><p class="indent" >  “I think it was the Russian maﬁa. They have grown big in our part of the
world.”
</p><!--l. 13870--><p class="indent" >  “No, that can&#x2019;t be it. They have been working with the C.I.A. for some time. They

have similar goals.”
</p><!--l. 13873--><p class="indent" >  It is a private war behind the scenes, with governments, corporations, the U.N. and
the federated maﬁa all vying for control. It feels like the Day of the Condor,
Bollywood style.
</p><!--l. 13877--><p class="indent" >  She meets the contact here. She discovers that he is one of the characters she has
been talking to in the VR.
</p><!--l. 13880--><p class="indent" >  “I am just an analyst.”
</p><!--l. 13884--><p class="indent" >  “You wanna go out tonight? See the city?”
</p><!--l. 13886--><p class="indent" >  She is bored with herself. What else could she say?
</p><!--l. 13888--><p class="indent" >  “Thank you.”

</p><!--l. 13906--><p class="indent" >  Tree surgeons are battling with the tree&#x2019;s assumption of control, using weapons that

</p><!--l. 13917--><p class="indent" >  He looks out at the London skyline, consumed with hard concentration. He is that
tree: a message desperate to compete with a million others, against immovable odds,
and he is about to begin the next phase of his growth.
</p><!--l. 13922--><p class="indent" >  Returning from his trip from San Diego has felt like an anti-climax so far. His head
is swimming with the phantoms of conversations and sensations: sensations of a
privileged lifestyle, of sunshine and change, and of Cathy Kim. What a desirable
woman she is.
</p><!--l. 13927--><p class="indent" >  He went to San Diego to move GrapeVine into the hot seat of directed imaging: to
exploit the advantages that a U.K. company has for an American business: to divest
accountability, and navigate a way around U.S. information legislation that
would make the gaming operations more transparent than the consortium
would like. It is a lucrative if not entirely honest assignment, but it seems
no worse to the board than any other job in advertising. The aim is not to
be fair and reﬂective, but to push and to sell. No qualms of conscience are
necessary.
</p><!--l. 13937--><p class="indent" >  And for his own sake, his aim, to steer the event to his own advantage, was a

moderate success? He was called in and told what to do by Cathy and then by
the Senator. . . but he put himself in that position. It was his choice, wasn&#x2019;t
it?
</p><!--l. 13942--><p class="indent" >  So he was noticed. He was a success. And yet his own weakness for female grace
has left him committed to helping Cathy Kim rise up the rungs of her own
evolutionary ladder. Who is actually steering this ship? Is it really to his beneﬁt too?
What has he actually signed himself up for?
</p><!--l. 13948--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Networking, Den. Networking.</span>
</p><!--l. 13950--><p class="indent" >  In some ways he is glad to be back. There are interesting challenges afoot and
dreaming about them doesn&#x2019;t help. There is work to be done. That means he will be
here in London for a little while. That, in itself, in a novelty. He does not
often spend much time in the London oﬃce. It has always seemed preferable
to orchestrate the activities from his private home in the High Wycombe
countryside, where he can look out across the misty hills and count sheep
as he works. Better than counting cars locked in battle in London&#x2019;s metal
aneurism.
</p><!--l. 13959--><p class="indent" >  “Den!” A colleague shouts from across the oﬃce space beyond his open door.
“Looks like you did well, my old son!”
</p><!--l. 13962--><p class="indent" >  “We aim to please.”
</p><!--l. 13964--><p class="indent" >  “Good on ya.” He disappears from sight, only to return a moment later, leaning on
the open doorway, shirt sleeves rolled up and tablet in hand. “Hey, by the way, our
contract with Amidrug might be in trouble. Did you hear the latest on the Safety
Commission?”
</p><!--l. 13969--><p class="indent" >  “No, I&#x2019;ve been too tied up in the gaming stuﬀ.”
</p><!--l. 13971--><p class="indent" >  “No kidding. Well, it&#x2019;s like this. The Consumer Safety Commission has decreed
that the competing ADD drugs are all unsafe by American standards and have
to be regulated by batch testing. Novarctic reckon that&#x2019;s going to throttle
their supply channel so much that they will not be able to sustain a market
presence.”
</p><!--l. 13977--><p class="indent" >  “Crafty bastards.”
</p><!--l. 13979--><p class="indent" >  “No shit. They&#x2019;re well pissed oﬀ.”
</p><!--l. 13981--><p class="indent" >  “And that means. . .that Amidrug don&#x2019;t need to advertise as much to dominate the
market?”
</p><!--l. 13984--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s the size of it, mate.”
</p><!--l. 13986--><p class="indent" >  Den frowns. The American Consumer Product Safety Commission has been
placing tight restrictions on their reputedly free markets for a long time, a bone of
contention for advertisers for years. The slogan of their free market economy is really:
you are free to leave prison and compete in the world, but please wear this
straitjacket. They bury competitors in pointless bureaucracy: counting the railings in
children&#x2019;s cots and enforcing higher standards on imports than om home-grown
products.
</p><!--l. 13995--><p class="indent" >  “So are we screwed or can we persuade them to move to where they will need us
even more?”

</p><!--l. 13998--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t know yet. It&#x2019;s still on-going. Just thought I&#x2019;d give you an update.”
</p><!--l. 14000--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah, thanks.”
</p><!--l. 14002--><p class="indent" >  “You probably have enough to think about.”
</p><!--l. 14004--><p class="indent" >  “Small under-statement.”
</p><!--l. 14006--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah – well are you gonna join us down the Elephant and Castle later on? We&#x2019;re
having a few beers after work to lighten the mood.”
</p><!--l. 14009--><p class="indent" >  “We&#x2019;ll see. I might be heading back to Wycombe.”
</p><!--l. 14011--><p class="indent" >  “Nah. Leave it out. You wanna get your arse down the pub and get some decent
beer back inside you, my son. It&#x2019;s all this American piss water that&#x2019;s messing up your
head.”
</p><!--l. 14015--><p class="indent" >  Den shrugs with his eyebrows. “Well, don&#x2019;t count me out yet. I&#x2019;ll have to see how
far I get with this follow-up. I haven&#x2019;t quite got it sussed out yet.”
</p><!--l. 14019--><p class="indent" >  “Denny boy, a few beers will make everything clearer.” He laughs. “We&#x2019;ll be going
from here about half-ﬁve, awright?”
</p><!--l. 14022--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah, cheers.”
</p><!--l. 14024--><p class="indent" >  “See ya.”
</p><!--l. 14026--><p class="indent" >  He disappears from view.
</p><!--l. 14028--><p class="indent" >  Den picks up a tablet and starts to sketch a plan. He writes the name of the Senator,
and Cathy Kim, and the consortium in a triangle and pulls up his notes on each. The
plans for the consortium are the most complete. They have been working on that for
some time. Then he starts to make a list of tasks under each name, grouping the
activities that are compatible and common between them. Information gathering.
Weaknesses. Attack analysis. It takes half an hour before he can see any
structure in it, but there is something there to get started on. If GrapeVine
starts on the common aspects ﬁrst, it will proceed more quickly. He should
bring the others into it as soon as possible, and yet he has a nagging worry
about what it is he is supposed to be doing. What was meant to be his grip on
the future, on the latest game technology, is starting to be more a potential
liability.
</p><!--l. 14043--><p class="indent" >  An intern knocks at his open doorway.
</p><!--l. 14045--><p class="indent" >  “Mr. Morris?”
</p><!--l. 14047--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s me.”
</p><!--l. 14049--><p class="indent" >  “Uhm..”
</p><!--l. 14051--><p class="indent" >  “Come on in, Raj.”
</p><!--l. 14053--><p class="indent" >  “Sorry to interrupt, sir.”
</p><!--l. 14055--><p class="indent" >  “No problem. What can I do you for?”
</p><!--l. 14057--><p class="indent" >  “Mr. Brown asked me to give you these.”
</p><!--l. 14059--><p class="indent" >  “Courier work, eh? Nice of him to make good use of your skills.”
</p><!--l. 14061--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t mind.”
</p><!--l. 14063--><p class="indent" >  “Just as well.”
</p><!--l. 14065--><p class="indent" >  He hands him a pair of cards, of the kind typically used for carrying encrypted
data.
</p><!--l. 14068--><p class="indent" >  “What&#x2019;s this about?”

</p><!--l. 14070--><p class="indent" >  “Designs from the Conway job, innit. Billboards and stuﬀ. He said you know the
project keys.”
</p><!--l. 14073--><p class="indent" >  “Ugh. Okay. Thanks.” He puts them distractedly to one side of his desk.
</p><!--l. 14075--><p class="indent" >  “Aren&#x2019;t you going to look at them?”
</p><!--l. 14077--><p class="indent" >  “Later. I&#x2019;m sort of busy on something else right now.”
</p><!--l. 14079--><p class="indent" >  “From your trip?”
</p><!--l. 14081--><p class="indent" >  “Yes.”
</p><!--l. 14083--><p class="indent" >  “How was your presentation?”
</p><!--l. 14085--><p class="indent" >  Den looks up at him from his tablet screen. “Good question,” he says. “Good
question.”
</p><!--l. 14088--><p class="indent" >  “Okay.”
</p><!--l. 14090--><p class="indent" >  “I think it went well.”
</p><!--l. 14092--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m sure it was very good, Mr. Morris.”
</p><!--l. 14094--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah.”
</p><!--l. 14096--><p class="indent" >  “I have seen you make presentations before.”
</p><!--l. 14098--><p class="indent" >  “Really?”
</p><!--l. 14100--><p class="indent" >  “At the annual kickoﬀ.”
</p><!--l. 14102--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s right. You remember that?” He snorts, recalling.
</p><!--l. 14104--><p class="indent" >  “You are an excellent speaker.”
</p><!--l. 14106--><p class="indent" >  “Thanks, Raj. That&#x2019;s kind. I guess it went okay.”
</p><!--l. 14108--><p class="indent" >  “Okay?”
</p><!--l. 14110--><p class="indent" >  Den frowns. “It was ﬁne. It just didn&#x2019;t have quite the eﬀect I had imagined, that&#x2019;s
all.”
</p><!--l. 14113--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t understand.”
</p><!--l. 14115--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s not that important. I&#x2019;m just a bit tired from the trip. Ask me again tomorrow.”
He grins.
</p><!--l. 14118--><p class="indent" >  “Did you make the contacts you were hoping for?”
</p><!--l. 14120--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s the strange thing. . .”
</p><!--l. 14122--><p class="indent" >  “How so, Mr. Morris?”
</p><!--l. 14124--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I don&#x2019;t know what I was expecting, really.”
</p><!--l. 14126--><p class="indent" >  “But you made contacts.”
</p><!--l. 14128--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, yes. An ambitious individual and a balmy senator.” He laughs.
</p><!--l. 14130--><p class="indent" >  The intern shrugs.
</p><!--l. 14132--><p class="indent" >  “I think I was looking to impress people by our work so that more clients would be
interested in work from us of the same kind. Instead, I have simply earned greater
trust from a couple of people deeper down who want to use us for their own special
agendas.”
</p><!--l. 14137--><p class="indent" >  “They say that the Lord works in mysterious ways.”
</p><!--l. 14139--><p class="indent" >  “So I&#x2019;ve heard.”
</p><!--l. 14141--><p class="indent" >  “So. Is there anything I can do to help? You could use an intern on this, right, Mr.
Morris?”
</p><!--l. 14143--><p class="indent" >  Den smiles, recognizing ambition. “What did you have in mind?”

</p><!--l. 14145--><p class="indent" >  “Well, the way I see it, Mr. Henderson doesn&#x2019;t really need me. I am just
wasting my time on the Conway project. I was wondering if you needed any
help?”
</p><!--l. 14149--><p class="indent" >  “You want to work up here?”
</p><!--l. 14151--><p class="indent" >  “I have alway been interested in the VR gaming.”
</p><!--l. 14153--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah. . .” Den is distant, as if contemplating.
</p><!--l. 14155--><p class="indent" >  “Of course, you probably don&#x2019;t need any help. I just thought, if I could get some
experience. . .”
</p><!--l. 14157--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t know. Maybe. Just a sec.” Den strides across his room and fumbles in his
jacket pocket for a storage card. The work he did on the plane is on it. He spent some
time relating strategies, which they have been using for the game, to the points raised
by the activists he met. Their angle showed up several weaknesses in the
consortium objectives. He pulls the card out of a pocket, blows ﬂuﬀ oﬀ it and
slots it into the top of his tablet. He ﬂips through his ﬁles and pulls up the
cause-chart.
</p><!--l. 14166--><p class="indent" >  “What do you make of this?”
</p><!--l. 14168--><p class="indent" >  Den hits the screen tab and the image on his tablet appears on the smart-wall next to
them, at three times the size.
</p><!--l. 14171--><p class="indent" >  “What is it?”
</p><!--l. 14173--><p class="indent" >  “A new project, related to the old one. Could be important for us. From my visit to
the States.”
</p><!--l. 14175--><p class="indent" >  “Well. . .”
</p><!--l. 14177--><p class="indent" >  “There&#x2019;s a lot going on here, and it looks at bit of a dog&#x2019;s dinner at the moment, but
it&#x2019;s related to what we&#x2019;ve been doing already. You&#x2019;ve been in on that haven&#x2019;t you? The
Chequers billboards and active motion analysis?”
</p><!--l. 14182--><p class="indent" >  “Yes. We did Chequers together.”
</p><!--l. 14184--><p class="indent" >  “Oh yes, so we did.” He sighs. “Must be getting old. Sorry. Well, take a look at this
then.” He points to the left hand side of the treelike ﬂow diagram, its lines and
boxes interweaving in complex ﬂows of cause and eﬀect. “The blue coloured
lines are input from a group of protesters that I met. That gave me some new
ideas.”
</p><!--l. 14190--><p class="indent" >  Raj studies the diagram for several minutes, saying nothing.
</p><!--l. 14192--><p class="indent" >  “Does it make any sense to you?”
</p><!--l. 14194--><p class="indent" >  He draws breath, and Den sees his youthful humility evaporate into conﬁdent
concentration as the cog-wheels go around inside his head.
</p><!--l. 14197--><p class="indent" >  “These extra inputs are from activists, as in the protesters that have been in the
news?”
</p><!--l. 14199--><p class="indent" >  “Exactly.”
</p><!--l. 14201--><p class="indent" >  “And . . . they are casting doubt on the older part of the causation model by
saying that the government&#x2019;s popular slogans are having the opposite eﬀect to
what they are supposed to have—I mean, at least it looks like it from your
notes.”
</p><!--l. 14206--><p class="indent" >  Smart kid. He is going to be a formidable colleague.

</p><!--l. 14209--><p class="indent" >  “Good.”
</p><!--l. 14211--><p class="indent" >  “At least, it looks that way. . .”
</p><!--l. 14213--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;d say that&#x2019;s a correct assessment of the situation.”
</p><!--l. 14215--><p class="indent" >  He looks pleased, then pleasure dissolves as he makes the next step in his mind.
“So. . .”
</p><!--l. 14218--><p class="indent" >  “So?”
</p><!--l. 14220--><p class="indent" >  “So who is right?”
</p><!--l. 14222--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s what we have to ﬁgure out.”
</p><!--l. 14224--><p class="indent" >  “It seems pretty important.”
</p><!--l. 14226--><p class="indent" >  Den laughs. “No shit. This could be the exact thing that makes or breaks our
campaign for the consortium. Of course, if the activists are right, then the consortium
is not going to like the answer.”
</p><!--l. 14230--><p class="indent" >  “You would tell them that everything they are doing is wrong?”
</p><!--l. 14232--><p class="indent" >  “We would have to make a little campaign of our own to break the news to them
gently.”
</p><!--l. 14234--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s funny.”
</p><!--l. 14236--><p class="indent" >  “Funny?”
</p><!--l. 14238--><p class="indent" >  “Having them pay us to persuade them that they are actually wrong.”
</p><!--l. 14240--><p class="indent" >  Den nods. “I see your point. Then again, that&#x2019;s what they are paying us for. To get
them results.” He paces around. “It&#x2019;s ironic though. I mean these activists were trying
to persuade me to help their cause, I think. If they have given us the very weapons to
help us to do what they don&#x2019;t want. . .”
</p><!--l. 14246--><p class="indent" >  “Then what?”
</p><!--l. 14248--><p class="indent" >  “Then what indeed.”
</p><!--l. 14250--><p class="indent" >  “Do you make the changes?”
</p><!--l. 14252--><p class="indent" >  “Then we make recommendations to our employer so that they get their
results.”
</p><!--l. 14255--><p class="indent" >  The intern&#x2019;s face seems to grapple with indecision. “Is that the right thing?”
</p><!--l. 14258--><p class="indent" >  “They are paying our bills. We are under contract.”
</p><!--l. 14260--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, yes,” he agrees and resumes his shawl of humility. “But what is it they
actually want to do? I&#x2019;m not sure I have understood it.”
</p><!--l. 14263--><p class="indent" >  Den nods. “That&#x2019;s it, isn&#x2019;t it? That is the sixty-four billion dollar question.”
</p><!--l. 14266--><p class="indent" >  “Mr. Morris?”
</p><!--l. 14268--><p class="indent" >  “Call me Den. What they want us to do, Raj, is to spread their gospel to
game-players everywhere. They want the world to trust them again, to see that
American stands for values that can be trusted. And they want Americans to lie down
quietly, like they used to.”
</p><!--l. 14273--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ll tell you what I see here, Mr. Morris,” the intern says. “I see the same old story.
People wanting to sell their product without any idea of what they are trying to
say.”
</p><!--l. 14277--><p class="indent" >  He ducks behind his eyes, as if fearing a come back, but Den nods to him. “Go
on.”

</p><!--l. 14280--><p class="indent" >  “This job is for the consortium. They are pretty much the government, as I see
it.”
</p><!--l. 14283--><p class="indent" >  Den shrugs. “Certainly, they are run more or less by the same people that make
Federal government policy.”
</p><!--l. 14285--><p class="indent" >  “Their message is banal and predictable. Support us. Do what we say. Be
satisﬁed with what you&#x2019;ve got. There&#x2019;s no imagination in the marketing. They
want us to create a message for them, because they don&#x2019;t have one of their
own”
</p><!--l. 14290--><p class="indent" >  Den looks at him.
</p><!--l. 14292--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s good,” he says, feeling a certain admiration for this youngster. “You&#x2019;ll do
well here, if any of us do.”
</p><!--l. 14295--><p class="indent" >  “Thanks.”
</p><!--l. 14297--><p class="indent" >  “You&#x2019;re welcome.”
</p><!--l. 14299--><p class="indent" >  “So. . .”
</p><!--l. 14301--><p class="indent" >  “So?”
</p><!--l. 14303--><p class="indent" >  “Can I work on this with you?” he asks.
</p><!--l. 14305--><p class="indent" >  “You want to help out?”
</p><!--l. 14307--><p class="indent" >  “I do.”
</p><!--l. 14309--><p class="indent" >  Den nods. “Sure. I think you are just what I need to sort this out.”
</p><!--l. 14311--><p class="indent" >  The intern grins and then suppresses it. “Can you tell Mr. Brown? He doesn&#x2019;t really
want me there anyway.”
</p><!--l. 14313--><p class="indent" >  “Hmmm.”
</p><!--l. 14315--><p class="indent" >  “Please? I am just wasting my time down there.”
</p><!--l. 14317--><p class="indent" >  “We can do it later. Right now, I want you to look at this part of the chart.” He
waves to a series of lines and arrows that seem to be feeding into the name of Cathy
Kim. “This person is a researcher who is working with U.S. law enforcement. She
wants us to cooperate with her organization to share the information we are authorized
to collect.”
</p><!--l. 14324--><p class="indent" >  Raj whistles. “You mean, break our NDAs?”
</p><!--l. 14326--><p class="indent" >  Den shrugs. “Perhaps. The rewards could be substantial, if we can impress the
right people. We should check what the Non Disclosure Agreements actually
say on the information we gather. If we can pass on information to them, in
conﬁdence, piggy-backing oﬀ another agreement, we might be able to do it
legally.”
</p><!--l. 14332--><p class="indent" >  Raj nods. “It might be doable. But. . .”
</p><!--l. 14334--><p class="indent" >  “Should we?”
</p><!--l. 14336--><p class="indent" >  “Is it ethical?”
</p><!--l. 14338--><p class="indent" >  “Raj, in this day and age, nothing is ethical. It&#x2019;s only ﬁnancial or personal.”
</p><!--l. 14341--><p class="indent" >  The intern looks uncomfortable.
</p><!--l. 14343--><p class="indent" >  “If we decide that this is something we want to pursue, the ethics of it are our
business. We just need to know who our allies are.”
</p><!--l. 14346--><p class="indent" >  “Then wouldn&#x2019;t we be behaving like the gangsters the government are
trying to abolish? Just looking after our own friends and to hell with anyone

else?”
</p><!--l. 14349--><p class="indent" >  Den nods. “Even national governments are just gangsters. It&#x2019;s not about whether
you are working for a gang or not—it&#x2019;s about how big and powerful your particular
gang is.”
</p><!--l. 14353--><p class="indent" >  Raj looks at him, as if to acknowledge that he already knew that, but was hoping to
be convinced otherwise. “We still need to check the legality of sharing that
information.”
</p><!--l. 14357--><p class="indent" >  “Agreed.”
</p><!--l. 14359--><p class="indent" >  “And you have have to get me out of the Conway job.”
</p><!--l. 14361--><p class="indent" >  Den smiles. “You don&#x2019;t give up easily do you?”
</p><!--l. 14363--><p class="indent" >  “I am here to learn.”
</p><!--l. 14365--><p class="indent" >  “And you are absolutely certain,” he teases.
</p><!--l. 14367--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, I am deﬁnitely interested. This is where I have the most to learn.”
</p><!--l. 14369--><p class="indent" >  “And this is what we are good at. It is why we were picked for this job.”
</p><!--l. 14371--><p class="indent" >  “So the Conway job. . .?”
</p><!--l. 14373--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I don&#x2019;t know. . .we might still need you on that.”
</p><!--l. 14375--><p class="indent" >  “Please?”
</p><!--l. 14377--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ll see what I can do.”
</p><!--l. 14379--><p class="indent" >  He grins. “Then I&#x2019;ll start planning. Can I make a copy of this?” He gestures to the
wall chart.
</p><!--l. 14382--><p class="indent" >  Den nods and pokes some menus on his tablet. “I&#x2019;ll add you to this project. Add
your key, and we&#x2019;ll brainstorm this together for a little while, before bringing in
anyone else, okay?”
</p><!--l. 14386--><p class="indent" >  “Okay!”
</p><!--l. 14388--><p class="indent" >  “Good, now you&#x2019;d better get back. Come back here in a couple of hours. I have to
do a few things ﬁrst.”
</p><!--l. 14391--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, Mr. Morris.”
</p><!--l. 14393--><p class="indent" >  “Call me Den.”
</p><!--l. 14395--><p class="indent" >  Den checks his messages on the tablet, with a sense of having made progress
without actually doing anything. He should call up Mary and see whats she has for
him.
</p><!--l. 14399--><p class="indent" >  But ﬁrst things ﬁrst. He, they, need some legal advice.

<!--l. 14405--><p class="indent" >  A young woman, slender, long legs, with dark-auburn, shoulder-length hair, in a
smart grey skirt-suit comes down the hall towards him. He follows her approach,
admiring her grace. They play these games.
</p><!--l. 14410--><p class="indent" >  She has that fashionable ragged look, contrasting with the smart look of her dark
grey skirt-suit. He scans her body curves and secret places and re-aﬃrms that

she could satisfy his carnal craving, as she always does. She has a magic.
Something.
</p><!--l. 14415--><p class="indent" >  For a moment he is unsettled by her presence. His instincts rebel against one
another. Is it not true that he has made an unspoken promise to Cathy Kim now? So
soon after seeing her, he should not be attracted to Kylie. But has he made any
promise? Has she? Their union was surely one of admiration, not one of
obligation.
</p><!--l. 14421--><p class="indent" >  “Love”, she taunts, in a cute Scottish accent.
</p><!--l. 14423--><p class="indent" >  “Excuse me?”
</p><!--l. 14425--><p class="indent" >  “Love,” she repeats, and smiles with her characteristic, cheeky sarcasm.
“You were thinking about sex. You are supposed to do it in connection with
love.”
</p><!--l. 14429--><p class="indent" >  “Right. I hadn&#x2019;t thought about that.”
</p><!--l. 14431--><p class="indent" >  She smiles at him conﬁdently as if asking: do you recognize me then? We ﬂirted
with each other last time you were in town.
</p><!--l. 14434--><p class="indent" >  “Did you want something?”
</p><!--l. 14436--><p class="indent" >  “You&#x2019;re a guy.” She beams.
</p><!--l. 14438--><p class="indent" >  The Scottish are the masters of sarcasm, Den thinks. They make an anti-social
rudeness into charming entertainment. One has to admire the sculpting of personal
image that allows something so negative to become so positive. They make
excellent marketeers, he decides and pigeon-holes the thought for future analysis.
She looks him up and down, pausing a little too long at his crotch to tease,
and then looks right to his face, unblinking. “I am stuck on this American
project.”
</p><!--l. 14447--><p class="indent" >  “Which one?” The ID badge on her waist shows an unﬂattering picture with the
name Kylie McLachlan.
</p><!--l. 14450--><p class="indent" >  “The free coke and training shoes with every burger ad&#x2019; to train the punters to
swallow American nationalist bullshit. . .what do you think?” Again the raised
eyebrow, beady eyed glare. “It&#x2019;s not important. I need to really sell this to a big
American company, pretending to be a world government, with lots of dosh, tosh.
It&#x2019;s for The Client. Any ideas?” She is obviously just ﬂirting with him so
he plays the part. She is not merely attractive, she is sexy. Especially the
accent.
</p><!--l. 14459--><p class="indent" >  Den shrugs. “Standard formula. Fill it with glorious adverbs, and then say: you
KNOW it makes sense!.”
</p><!--l. 14462--><p class="indent" >  “Can&#x2019;t,” she says. “No adverbs.”
</p><!--l. 14464--><p class="indent" >  “Oh?”
</p><!--l. 14466--><p class="indent" >  “Americans have obliterated the adverb, as you should know, Mr. Morris, having
just returned from their play pen.”
</p><!--l. 14468--><p class="indent" >  “What?”
</p><!--l. 14470--><p class="indent" >  She summons herself, looking at her pad, waves a theatrical hand and
proclaims:

     <span 
class="ptmr7t-">“Go quiet in the push and shove</span><br

</p><!--l. 14483--><p class="indent" >  Den looks at her blankly, uncertain as to whether he has understood her satire, if
that is what it was.
</p><!--l. 14486--><p class="indent" >  She looks quizzical and continues: “And how are you Mrs. MacenBurger? ‘Good!
Real good!&#x2019; Well I am sorry, Mrs. MacenBurger but we&#x2019;ll have to see what Santa
Claus has to say about that! Or did you mean: really well?”
</p><!--l. 14490--><p class="indent" >  Den has no idea what she is talking about, but he cannot help himself and a smile
breaks onto his lips.
</p><!--l. 14493--><p class="indent" >  Finally, she gives up waiting a response. “Never mind. You English have no sense
of humus.” She winks. ”There are no adverbs. But I need to talk to you about your
project.”
</p><!--l. 14497--><p class="indent" >  “You got my message then?”
</p><!--l. 14499--><p class="indent" >  “I did.”
</p><!--l. 14501--><p class="indent" >  “Have you looked at the contracts?”
</p><!--l. 14503--><p class="indent" >  “I have.”
</p><!--l. 14505--><p class="indent" >  He waits for more. “So? Don&#x2019;t keep me in suspense.”
</p><!--l. 14507--><p class="indent" >  She sighs. “You can&#x2019;t do it.”
</p><!--l. 14509--><p class="indent" >  “Can&#x2019;t do what?”
</p><!--l. 14511--><p class="indent" >  “You can&#x2019;t take on these side projects, disclosing information that is gathered in
connection with the others.”
</p><!--l. 14514--><p class="indent" >  She looks at his smart wall, that displays his reﬁned causation chart. He has tidied it
up and added pictures of Cathy Kim and the Senator to remind himself that they are
people.
</p><!--l. 14518--><p class="indent" >  “Can we share information, legally, with these American law enforcement
people.”
</p><!--l. 14520--><p class="indent" >  “Is she really law enforcement?”
</p><!--l. 14522--><p class="indent" >  “Yes. No. . .I don&#x2019;t think so.”
</p><!--l. 14524--><p class="indent" >  “What about our Non-Disclosure Agreements?”
</p><!--l. 14526--><p class="indent" >  “Is that her? Very nice. . .” She whistles and nudges him irritatingly. “Our
commitment is clear. We are supposed to generate billboard content and story-lines
for the game scenarios. We are not supposed to divulge our research to third
parties.”
</p><!--l. 14531--><p class="indent" >  “Are they really third parties though? I mean the Senator is part of the consortium,
as I understand it. And Kim. . .”
</p><!--l. 14534--><p class="indent" >  “Your fancy woman.”

</p><!--l. 14536--><p class="indent" >  “What?”
</p><!--l. 14538--><p class="indent" >  “Sorry. Your law enforcement researcher. . .what is she really?”
</p><!--l. 14540--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I haven&#x2019;t checked her out fully. . .”
</p><!--l. 14542--><p class="indent" >  She smirks. “Really? You must be slipping, Denny.”
</p><!--l. 14544--><p class="indent" >  “We would obviously have to do that.”
</p><!--l. 14546--><p class="indent" >  “Obviously,” she nods, turning her head slightly to view him through the corner of
her eyes..
</p><!--l. 14549--><p class="indent" >  “But if she is a legitimate part of the consortium, by contract, then what?”
</p><!--l. 14551--><p class="indent" >  “Well it would depend on what kind of contract.”
</p><!--l. 14553--><p class="indent" >  “But if she is working in their best interests?”
</p><!--l. 14555--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m afraid that would not be a precise enough criterion for their lawyers.”
</p><!--l. 14557--><p class="indent" >  “So you don&#x2019;t think it is doable?”
</p><!--l. 14560--><p class="indent" >  Kylie McLachlan&#x2019;s humorous facade wavers.
</p><!--l. 14562--><p class="indent" >  “Den. . .”
</p><!--l. 14564--><p class="indent" >  “Ms McLachlan?”
</p><!--l. 14566--><p class="indent" >  She sighs, showing frustration. “I think you must be a little crazy to take on this
thing in the ﬁrst place.”
</p><!--l. 14569--><p class="indent" >  “Really. Is that a professional opinion? I didn&#x2019;t know you had been studying
psychiatry.”
</p><!--l. 14572--><p class="indent" >  “Oh, you&#x2019;d be surprised what we legal people have to know.. But all this goes just a
little beyond advertising, don&#x2019;t you think?”
</p><!--l. 14575--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s a natural progression. It&#x2019;s excellent money. It is not something that I could say
no to easily. If I had said no, we could have been dropped like a hot potato. The end of
our contract and we might never be able to get back into it again. Not only the end of
our contract but the end of our business. The future of advertising is in the
game.”
</p><!--l. 14582--><p class="indent" >  “So you let them push you around and pull your strings?”
</p><!--l. 14584--><p class="indent" >  “I did some pushing,” he protests. “I pushed.”
</p><!--l. 14586--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s not the kind of pushing I was thinking of,” she chides. “I know you too
well, Den.”
</p><!--l. 14589--><p class="indent" >  He ignores the innuendo. “I just thought that, it&#x2019;s better to have their trust and to be
on the inside than on the outside. If we are working with them, we can inﬂuence the
direction of things. If we are on the outside, we are completely at their mercy. I don&#x2019;t
like being in that situation.”
</p><!--l. 14595--><p class="indent" >  “So you were merely working undercover. I see. Well done, Mr. Bond. Of course,
you realize that you have just likened their behaviour to just one more of these
American gangs. Isn&#x2019;t that where most of them hang out, along the Mexican
border?”
</p><!--l. 14600--><p class="indent" >  “Kyl. . .”
</p><!--l. 14602--><p class="indent" >  “Den, wake up. You might have gone there with the intention of securing our
future, but they seem to be using that over-willingness to wrap you around their little
ﬁnger. Who is really in charge?”

</p><!--l. 14606--><p class="indent" >  He stares out of the window at his tree. Many of its larger branches are now gone.
What is left is a knobbly trunk of stumps.
</p><!--l. 14609--><p class="indent" >  “I was invited to play a special role. That&#x2019;s all. What they are suggesting is not
something illegal or anything.”
</p><!--l. 14612--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s invading people&#x2019;s recreational space with zombie juice, that&#x2019;s what it
is.”
</p><!--l. 14615--><p class="indent" >  For the ﬁrst time, since he has known her, Den thinks that she looks genuinely
upset.
</p><!--l. 14618--><p class="indent" >  “Look at it this way: we are just helping them to maintain the American
dream.”
</p><!--l. 14621--><p class="indent" >  “Ah, the American dream. Fine. Say no more. Well, we&#x2019;re very sorry to disappoint
you, Captain America – you see, here in Great Britain we don&#x2019;t have a dream. That&#x2019;s
because we are actually awake.”
</p><!--l. 14625--><p class="indent" >  “So, you are not keen then,” he inﬂects with a little irony.
</p><!--l. 14627--><p class="indent" >  “The consortium is a well-deﬁned entity, Den. Even if one of its members wanted
to ask you for services outside of the scope of the agreement, it would be
dodgy. America is litigation central. You don&#x2019;t want to mess with that kind of
thing.”
</p><!--l. 14632--><p class="indent" >  “Well, they are going to come back to me. It will be diﬃcult to go back on this
now. That much is certain. I think they now view us as the experts in this
area.”
</p><!--l. 14636--><p class="indent" >  “And you think we could handle it, even if it were legal?”
</p><!--l. 14638--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, I do. I think it puts us in the driving seat. If we are on the inside, then we can
take charge in our own way. After all, we will be the one&#x2019;s with access to the
billboards.”
</p><!--l. 14642--><p class="indent" >  “Just as well.”
</p><!--l. 14644--><p class="indent" >  “Why?”
</p><!--l. 14646--><p class="indent" >  “Because it is probably going of be a pile of trouble for us.”
</p><!--l. 14648--><p class="indent" >  “So what should I do?”
</p><!--l. 14650--><p class="indent" >  “Well. We&#x2019;ll need some kind of policy for dealing with this senator friend of yours.
You realize that, here in the U,K. you could be thrown in prison under the
oﬃcial secrets act for saying anything that the government doesn&#x2019;t like. It isn&#x2019;t
like in the U.S. where they have freedom of speech and information, you
know.”
</p><!--l. 14656--><p class="indent" >  “Maybe that is why they are keen for a British company to be involved?”
</p><!--l. 14659--><p class="indent" >  “Now we&#x2019;re approaching the truth perhaps. The British government are involved in
this too?”
</p><!--l. 14662--><p class="indent" >  “They have links to the consortium, I think.”
</p><!--l. 14664--><p class="indent" >  “We need to be very careful.”
</p><!--l. 14666--><p class="indent" >  Den looks suddenly downcast. What seems like a good idea suddenly seems more
like the rope that will hang him.
</p><!--l. 14669--><p class="indent" >  “And I thought I was onto something.”
</p><!--l. 14671--><p class="indent" >  “More like someone.” She winces. “Sorry – I have to stop that. Bad habit.”

</p><!--l. 14674--><p class="indent" >  Her expression softens and resumes its playfulness. She has beautiful, lively green
eyes, he thinks. She steps forward and takes his ﬁngers and hand and pulls him
towards the door.
</p><!--l. 14678--><p class="indent" >  “Come on,” she says. “I&#x2019;ll buy you a bad Italian coﬀee around the corner and you&#x2019;ll
tell me more about what actually happened in the land of two for the price of
one.”
</p><!--l. 14682--><p class="indent" >  He withdraws his hand and nods.

</p><!--l. 14685--><p class="noindent" >*</p></div>
<!--l. 14691--><p class="indent" >  Kylie McLachlan plays with the foam on her cappuccino. The little coﬀee shop is
arty but cramped; it is starting to thin out after a post lunch-time burst of activity. The
air smells of fresh coﬀee and chocolate, and the gurgling hiss of the espresso machine
forces them to speak more loudly than they would like. Den pulls at a croissant and
eats as she speaks.
</p><!--l. 14698--><p class="indent" >  “Hawshaw&#x2019;s a sweet old man who has had dealings with my family for years.” Her
face becomes strangely calm, when she is not joking. Den likes it. Her eyes like
pools of water. “He used to deal in jewellery until gold became the symbol of
the gang culture. When it changed from a symbol of overt wealth to one of
intellectual poverty, he decided that it was no longer something he could deal
in.”
</p><!--l. 14705--><p class="indent" >  She stirs the foam.
</p><!--l. 14707--><p class="indent" >  “He died last year. Just before then, he told me that you should never sacriﬁce
principles for the common will. He found the idea vulgar. Noble ideas come from
individuals with strong messages, not weak instincts that are programmed into our
biology. Strong messages emerge from the chaos of a melting pot of minds and build a
consensus against the odds. They win by natural selection, because they are better
than the alternatives.”
</p><!--l. 14715--><p class="indent" >  “Fine philosophy.”
</p><!--l. 14717--><p class="indent" >  “He died for it.”
</p><!--l. 14719--><p class="indent" >  Den takes a sip of his own blend. “I wonder if anyone can aﬀord to keep to
principles like that in this day and age?”
</p><!--l. 14722--><p class="indent" >  “What makes you think they can&#x2019;t?”
</p><!--l. 14724--><p class="indent" >  “Too many pressures.”
</p><!--l. 14726--><p class="indent" >  “Pressures?”
</p><!--l. 14728--><p class="indent" >  “Politics of production.”
</p><!--l. 14730--><p class="indent" >  A trace of a smile waxes then wanes. “Oh ye man-folk of little backbone.”
</p><!--l. 14732--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m serious. We are constantly under pressure today. It&#x2019;s the economics of our
time. Back in the days of Queen Victoria, you could perhaps have had some lofty
ambitions about building a better world, but now it&#x2019;s more cut-throat than

that.”
</p><!--l. 14737--><p class="indent" >  “Oh that&#x2019;s nonsense. I&#x2019;m serious too,” she counters. “And I&#x2019;m not sure that it was
not even more cut-throat in Victoria&#x2019;s day.”
</p><!--l. 14740--><p class="indent" >  “Everything is about production goals now. The numbers are more important than
the results. Quality is measured as throughput.”
</p><!--l. 14743--><p class="indent" >  “Time is money. It was always a rather simplistic equation.”
</p><!--l. 14745--><p class="indent" >  “But we believe it more these days.”
</p><!--l. 14747--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s a pretty weak excuse.” She puts on a stern expression. “What kind of a man
do you claim to be, Den Morris?”
</p><!--l. 14750--><p class="indent" >  “Sorry, I left my sporran by the vanity mirror.”
</p><!--l. 14752--><p class="indent" >  “Really? How interesting.” She grins. “But you know something? I&#x2019;m not sure
anyone was ever encouraged to stand up to anyone else, not in history, not
now. If you are going to make a stand on principles then you have to do it
without the sanction of your proverbial ‘times&#x2019;. That&#x2019;s just the sad lament of the
wicked.”
</p><!--l. 14758--><p class="indent" >  Den stuﬀs a piece of croissant into his mouth to avoid having to reply.
</p><!--l. 14760--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s where dear old Mr. Hawshaw was a hero. I tend to think that the
strong characters of history have always been the ones who were just crazy
enough to defy common lore and stick to their guns like that. None of them had
their lives made easier by making the choices that they made, but somehow
they traded practical discomfort for an equivalent mental anguish. Though
they do tend to be revered posthumously rather than by their peers, which is
unfortunate.”
</p><!--l. 14768--><p class="indent" >  “Mary Queen of Scots?”
</p><!--l. 14770--><p class="indent" >  “Speaking of cut-throat.”
</p><!--l. 14772--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s not a very comforting thought.”
</p><!--l. 14774--><p class="indent" >  “You might be right, but come on. Maybe that&#x2019;s exactly our problem these days: too
much comfort. We&#x2019;re not used to getting our hands dirty, not willing to take chances
anymore. The pain threshold is lower. Everything is too safe, too controlled.” She
shakes her hands in mock fear. “We never even try to swim upstream because we can&#x2019;t
dial it up on our mobile.”
</p><!--l. 14781--><p class="indent" >  “Is that what you think I&#x2019;m being asked to do? Go with the ﬂow?”
</p><!--l. 14783--><p class="indent" >  “Isn&#x2019;t that what marketing is about? Creating a ﬂow to go with?”
</p><!--l. 14785--><p class="indent" >  “Partly, I suppose.”
</p><!--l. 14787--><p class="indent" >  “Seems to me that these cronies from Washington have created a ﬂow of their own,
with the meeting you attended, and they sucked you right in, with a little rattling of
the bling bling.”
</p><!--l. 14791--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t think of myself as a gangster yet.”
</p><!--l. 14793--><p class="indent" >  “Glad to hear it, Den Morris. Wi&#x2019;or&#x2019;wi&#x2019;out yarr sporran.”
</p><!--l. 14795--><p class="indent" >  Den smiles.
</p><!--l. 14797--><p class="indent" >  “There, that&#x2019;s better.”
</p><!--l. 14799--><p class="indent" >  “What?”
</p><!--l. 14801--><p class="indent" >  “A smile.”

</p><!--l. 14803--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m a little ray of sunshine.”
</p><!--l. 14805--><p class="indent" >  “Do you good to laugh a little more. You always were a rather serious man, Den
Morris.”
</p><!--l. 14808--><p class="indent" >  “Me?”
</p><!--l. 14810--><p class="indent" >  “Oh, not so?”
</p><!--l. 14812--><p class="indent" >  “I have no idea what you&#x2019;re talking about.”
</p><!--l. 14814--><p class="indent" >  “We see it you know,” she says.
</p><!--l. 14816--><p class="indent" >  “Sorry?”
</p><!--l. 14818--><p class="indent" >  “We see the change.”
</p><!--l. 14820--><p class="indent" >  His face is a question mark.
</p><!--l. 14822--><p class="indent" >  “In society. I have a friend who is a barrister, working on criminal law. He&#x2019;s a bit
older than I am. He says that people do not have the same concept of right and wrong
as they used to.”
</p><!--l. 14826--><p class="indent" >  “Doesn&#x2019;t every generation say that?”
</p><!--l. 14828--><p class="indent" >  “Possibly, but it is not always objectively true.”
</p><!--l. 14830--><p class="indent" >  “And he thinks it is true now? Why?”
</p><!--l. 14832--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s because we have everything we want. You and I are criminals. The law does
not have daily consequences for us, so we tend to ignore it, try its limits. In the past
you would have had to rely more on others around you. That&#x2019;s what makes society
work, and the law was made to reﬂect that cooperation. Today, your little gadgets
make you invincible and you don&#x2019;t have to think of the well-being of anyone except
your nearest and dearest. And if you should want for something, you can just order it
take-away from your wristband.”
</p><!--l. 14841--><p class="indent" >  “So you think people are weak?”
</p><!--l. 14843--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s not just that. They are not just weak, they are unable to appreciate the law.
Why should you agree to be nice to anyone else, when you can have anything you
want at the push of a button?”
</p><!--l. 14847--><p class="indent" >  “You are a misunderstood genius, Kyl.”
</p><!--l. 14849--><p class="indent" >  “Why thank you, sir.” she struts. “Then, have I ever told you that you are a
handsome man, and just a little sweet?”
</p><!--l. 14852--><p class="indent" >  “Now, that sounds a lot like me,” he agrees. “It&#x2019;s my ragged, unshaven
charm.”
</p><!--l. 14855--><p class="indent" >  “Something like that.”
</p><!--l. 14857--><p class="indent" >  Den looks at his wristband, stretches back and rubs that back of his neck. “I could

</p><!--l. 14860--><p class="indent" >  “Why not? Oﬀ you go then.”
</p><!--l. 14862--><p class="indent" >  “Want to join me?”
</p><!--l. 14864--><p class="indent" >  “Oh no. Not unless you talking about a quick one behind the bike shed?”
</p><!--l. 14866--><p class="indent" >  “Ah. Is that how you do it in the law courts?”
</p><!--l. 14868--><p class="indent" >  “Every chance we get.”
</p><!--l. 14870--><p class="indent" >  “Well not this time. I should really be getting back. This thing is buzzing away. . .”
He lifts and rattles his mobile wristband.
</p><!--l. 14873--><p class="indent" >  “Me too. Come on then.”

</p><!--l. 14875--><p class="indent" >  She rises up, pulling her skirt down a little as she extricates herself from the tables
and chair of the little coﬀee shop. Den follows.
</p><!--l. 14878--><p class="indent" >  They step out into the whining of the London Open Air Experience. It is slightly
quieter now, but the sound is more irritating. Den is still old enough that he
remembers the days before compulsory electriﬁcation of the inner-city traﬃc,
when the rumbling of petrol and diesel engines was the sound of the city
purring.
</p><!--l. 14884--><p class="indent" >  He puts his arm around Kylie McLachlan as they walk the hundred metres back to
Grapevine.
</p><!--l. 14887--><p class="indent" >  “You&#x2019;re worried about our complicity in something unethical?” he comments as
they walk.
</p><!--l. 14890--><p class="indent" >  She nods slightly. “It&#x2019;s not so much the ethics. You can debate that, but I am
worried about the complicity in something criminal.”
</p><!--l. 14893--><p class="indent" >  “This is congress and Interpol. They are the law.”
</p><!--l. 14895--><p class="indent" >  “Oh yes! Go Sylvester!”
</p><!--l. 14897--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t see that we are complicit by fulﬁlling a contract, if it comes to
that.”
</p><!--l. 14899--><p class="indent" >  “If it comes to something in writing, we are at least on ﬁrmer ground.”
</p><!--l. 14901--><p class="indent" >  “Did you see TIME?”
</p><!--l. 14903--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t read magazines much.”
</p><!--l. 14905--><p class="indent" >  “Never mind. I&#x2019;ll try to get something in writing.”
</p><!--l. 14907--><p class="indent" >  “If it&#x2019;s legit, they shouldn&#x2019;t mind.”
</p><!--l. 14909--><p class="indent" >  “I sort of have the feeling that&#x2019;s not the way it&#x2019;s supposed to be done here,” he says.
“It feels as though it should be a gentleman&#x2019;s agreement.”
</p><!--l. 14913--><p class="indent" >  “Well, without wanting to sound like a rabid feminist. I would say that gentlemen&#x2019;s
agreements are just a nice way of saying rampant corruption.”
</p><!--l. 14917--><p class="indent" >  Den does not reply.
</p><!--l. 14919--><p class="indent" >  “But I can try to call some friends and ask them to put out feelers?”
</p><!--l. 14921--><p class="indent" >  “To check out the legality?”
</p><!--l. 14923--><p class="indent" >  “To check out the people, ﬁrst. Do either of us really know who these people
are?”
</p><!--l. 14926--><p class="indent" >  “I got Mary to pull me a bunch of stuﬀ on Cathy Kim.”
</p><!--l. 14928--><p class="indent" >  “Is that what you call safe sex?”
</p><!--l. 14930--><p class="indent" >  “Just wanted to know who she was. She seemed legitimate.”
</p><!--l. 14932--><p class="indent" >  “Well, that kind of thing can easily be faked.”
</p><!--l. 14934--><p class="indent" >  They come to the Grapevine entrance and McLachlan stops..
</p><!--l. 14936--><p class="indent" >  She checks a list of contacts. “I could do some checking. I&#x2019;ve got Arjan Latiﬁ. He is
quite new to me, but he knows a lot about government dealings in the E.U.. He
might be able to help us. I can get Sanihje to call him up for lunch. She&#x2019;s a
sweetie.”
</p><!--l. 14941--><p class="indent" >  “Aaron Oxley came by and asked after you, by the way.”
</p><!--l. 14943--><p class="indent" >  “Me? Now what would he want?” She sighs.
</p><!--l. 14945--><p class="indent" >  “You coming back up?”

</p><!--l. 14947--><p class="indent" >  She shakes her head. “Have to be somewhere.”
</p><!--l. 14949--><p class="indent" >  “All right. See you then.”
</p><!--l. 14951--><p class="indent" >  She winks at him. “Yeah. Fuck you later, handsome.”

</p><!--l. 14959--><p class="indent" >  A ﬂuﬀy white face is peering at her through the brambles and branches. Vibe is
exhausted and shaken, but the sheep seems unconcerned of her plight. It is merely
curious as to what the hell she is doing there in such a stupid place. Well, she
thinks, if sheep have managed to get here, this must be about the stupidest
place to be. You can always trust sheep to get themselves into the biggest
trouble.
</p><!--l. 14966--><p class="indent" >  She feels herself beginning to tire. At least she is out of reach of her pursuers. It is
unlikely that they can hear her from up there. She has the aural camouﬂage of wind
and water to hide her.
</p><!--l. 14970--><p class="indent" >  The fear has passed, but she is as taut as the branch she is holding onto. If she
removes a hand, she will surely fall.
</p><!--l. 14973--><p class="indent" >  It reminds her dismally of a rock-climbing experience, when she was hanging on in
a freezing wind with ﬁngers she could barely feel. She was not even certain that her
cold body could move fast enough to save her if she moved, so she petriﬁed in that
position until someone tightened a rope. But there is no rope here to catch
her.
</p><!--l. 14979--><p class="indent" >  The sheep seems to lose interest in her, obviously she is not entertaining enough.
She needs to do something soon.
</p><!--l. 14982--><p class="indent" >  The mud beneath her seems to have packed since she stopped moving, and her
elbow is well dug in. She feels some purchase at her hip, and risks drawing her knees
up to her stomach. The extra strain on the branch makes it give a little, and she stops.
Another adrenalin ﬂood knocks her slightly senseless, and she has to pause. She tries
again, and this time manages to bring her boots up to the edge of the ledge, so that all
of her is on approximately solid ground. Now, if she can somehow pack the mud
underneath her, to get enough friction to press with her calves, she could
release one hand and try to get out of her backpack, which is pinning her
down.
</p><!--l. 14993--><p class="indent" >  The branch gives and she recoils. Her legs brake her slightly, but not enough and

she is catapulted uncontrollably backwards, and slides over the edge.
</p>

<!--l. 15002--><p class="indent" >  When she comes to her senses, Vibe is incredulous to ﬁnd that she has not moved
more than half a metre. Her backpack is snagged on a branch and it now pins her, on
her side, hanging just over the edge of the ledge. So all that time hanging on
had been a waste of strength. Now she is exhausted and just as trapped as
before.
</p><!--l. 15008--><p class="indent" >  She risks straining forward to look over the edge. It&#x2019;s not that far down to more
slope, but she would have hurt herself had she fallen uncontrolled. She reviews her
options. At least she now has her hands free. Her backside is wedge uncomfortably on
a rock at the edge. If she releases the backpack straps, it should be possible to get out
of it. Then, if she falls, at least she stands a chance of landing properly. What the
hell.
</p><!--l. 15016--><p class="indent" >  She undoes the waist strap, feeling the relief of pressure there, and then carefully
twists her upper arm out of the shoulder strap. It sears at her hip, with all her body
weight supported by the friction of her hip and buttock, but it feels solid enough to
roll onto her stomach and clutch at grass and shrubs with her hands. She is
out.
</p><!--l. 15023--><p class="indent" >  She drags her backpack free and clambers carefully down the remaining incline to
another rocky trail. Best to sit here for a moment and recover her state of
mind.
</p><!--l. 15028--><p class="indent" >  “Are you okay?” A voice calls, something between a call and a whisper. She hears
the rustling of a jacket running towards her.
</p><!--l. 15031--><p class="indent" >  Vibe looks around and sees a middle aged man in dark blue waterproofs clambering
over the terrain towards her.
</p><!--l. 15034--><p class="indent" >  “Are you Sara Stensrud?”
</p><!--l. 15036--><p class="indent" >  She starts and a ﬂood of adrenalin whitens the world. “How do. . .”
</p><!--l. 15038--><p class="indent" >  “About time too,” he says. “Wait a minute.”
</p><!--l. 15040--><p class="indent" >  He wriggles something in his gloves.
</p><!--l. 15042--><p class="indent" >  ”Frank? Checkpoint three. We&#x2019;ve found Sara.”
</p><!--l. 15044--><p class="indent" >  She stares at him. He does not look dangerous. He does not look like someone who
would threaten her.
</p><!--l. 15047--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m with the local police. Why didn&#x2019;t you report in sooner?”
</p><!--l. 15050--><p class="indent" >  She looks glum.
</p><!--l. 15052--><p class="indent" >  “Are you hurt?”
</p><!--l. 15054--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t think so.”
</p><!--l. 15056--><p class="indent" >  “You had a bit of a slide. You could have broken something.”
</p><!--l. 15058--><p class="indent" >  She nods.

</p><!--l. 15060--><p class="indent" >  “We thought perhaps you had had an accident or were in trouble.”
</p><!--l. 15062--><p class="indent" >  “As it happens. . .not until you came.”
</p><!--l. 15064--><p class="indent" >  Sceptical regard taints her welcome start.
</p><!--l. 15066--><p class="indent" >  “Sorry. I didn&#x2019;t mean it like that.”
</p><!--l. 15068--><p class="indent" >  “You could have ruined our operation.”
</p><!--l. 15070--><p class="indent" >  “Your operation?”
</p><!--l. 15072--><p class="indent" >  He sighs, and pulls his hood oﬀ, looking around. Lowering his voice again, he says:
“Haven&#x2019;t you been paying attention? We have a situation here. There are gangs
roaming around. We are still trying to round up the remainders. They can still be
dangerous.”.
</p><!--l. 15077--><p class="indent" >  She chews her lip and gives him sad puppy eyes. Best not to say anything for
now.
</p><!--l. 15080--><p class="indent" >  Ten minutes pass before Frank clambers into view.
</p><!--l. 15082--><p class="indent" >  “Hello again,” he says, panting.
</p><!--l. 15084--><p class="indent" >  “Hi.”
</p><!--l. 15086--><p class="indent" >  “You okay? Heard you had a fall. . .”
</p><!--l. 15088--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m okay.”
</p><!--l. 15090--><p class="indent" >  “Told you we should have walked together.”
</p><!--l. 15092--><p class="indent" >  She curls her lip.
</p><!--l. 15094--><p class="indent" >  “You didn&#x2019;t ﬁnd your friends, I take it?”
</p><!--l. 15096--><p class="indent" >  She shakes her head marginally. “I had this idea, and got distracted. I thought I
could ﬁnish my work. So I never made it to Leirvassbu and didn&#x2019;t ﬁnd them. I&#x2019;m
headed there now.”
</p><!--l. 15100--><p class="indent" >  “Not now you&#x2019;re not.”
</p><!--l. 15102--><p class="indent" >  “We&#x2019;d better get you to the road,” the other says.
</p><!--l. 15104--><p class="indent" >  “The road?”
</p><!--l. 15106--><p class="indent" >  “There&#x2019;s a patrol car waiting. But we&#x2019;ll have to wait a while. We have a straggler
coming this way.”
</p><!--l. 15110--><p class="indent" >  “But I have to get to Leirvassbu.”
</p><!--l. 15112--><p class="indent" >  “No way, not now. You&#x2019;ll have to come with us along the valley.”
</p><!--l. 15114--><p class="indent" >  “But..! I have a meeting I have to get to.”
</p><!--l. 15116--><p class="indent" >  “Sorry. That&#x2019;s out of the question now,” the other man says.
</p><!--l. 15118--><p class="indent" >  A surge of rage and tantrum threatens to surface in her. She recognizes it and
breathes slowly to let it pass.
</p><!--l. 15121--><p class="indent" >  “I was headed towards the cabin. I am supposed to be staying there with a private
group for a few days.”
</p><!--l. 15124--><p class="indent" >  “We can&#x2019;t let you spoil our operation. Anyway, it will be winter any day soon. You
shouldn&#x2019;t really be up here alone anyway. It&#x2019;s not safe.”
</p><!--l. 15127--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s why I need to ﬁnish my work. If I could only ﬁnd the team. . .”
</p><!--l. 15129--><p class="indent" >  “Hang on – we&#x2019;re on. Here he comes. We have his mobile signal. He should be line
of sight now. Better get down and look as though you are having a hiking
break.”
</p><!--l. 15133--><p class="indent" >  “Is that who was following me?”

</p><!--l. 15135--><p class="indent" >  “Our straggler. You saw him?”
</p><!--l. 15137--><p class="indent" >  “There was someone behind me. I could see him from up there. Maybe a kilometre
behind me. I didn&#x2019;t know who it was. I was taking the high road to stay dry and avoid
the bushes.”
</p><!--l. 15141--><p class="indent" >  “So why did you come down here?”
</p><!--l. 15143--><p class="indent" >  “I thought. . .”
</p><!--l. 15145--><p class="indent" >  They wait for her.
</p><!--l. 15147--><p class="indent" >  “I saw this other person up ahead and . . . it spooked me.”
</p><!--l. 15149--><p class="indent" >  “Why?”
</p><!--l. 15151--><p class="indent" >  She shrugs. Now is not the time to be telling them about Lindgren&#x2019;s bizarre
message. Stupid girl. “What makes you think he&#x2019;ll come down here?”
</p><!--l. 15155--><p class="indent" >  “We don&#x2019;t know. We have someone up there too. That&#x2019;s probably who you
saw.”
</p><!--l. 15158--><p class="indent" >  She nods.
</p><!--l. 15160--><p class="indent" >  “There are still two more that we haven&#x2019;t located yet.”
</p><!--l. 15162--><p class="indent" >  “Wait, I have an idea.”
</p><!--l. 15164--><p class="indent" >  They look at her quizzically.
</p><!--l. 15166--><p class="indent" >  “Maybe I can help?”
</p><!--l. 15170--><p class="indent" >  A message comes in; they do not have time to respond.
</p><!--l. 15172--><p class="indent" >  “Wait – Finn has him in sight. Top road. We&#x2019;re okay – just stay out of sight and
keep quiet.”
</p><!--l. 15175--><p class="indent" >  She purses her lips.
</p><!--l. 15178--><p class="indent" >  Quietly, he says: “We&#x2019;ll have to walk along the valley before we can get onto a trail
where we can use transport. From there we can take you to the lensman&#x2019;s
oﬃce.”
</p><!--l. 15183--><p class="indent" >  “Will I be allowed to come back up here and work again afterwards?”
</p><!--l. 15185--><p class="indent" >  “Can&#x2019;t say.”
</p><!--l. 15187--><p class="indent" >  “But my work?”
</p><!--l. 15189--><p class="indent" >  “Safety ﬁrst.”
</p><!--l. 15191--><p class="indent" >  Vibe ﬂicks through the settings on her mobile.
</p><!--l. 15193--><p class="indent" >  “What&#x2019;s that beeping?”
</p><!--l. 15195--><p class="indent" >  Shit. She looks more sheepish than the sheep she was staring at. “Something I was
supposed to do earlier. I have a form to send.”
</p><!--l. 15198--><p class="indent" >  “Sounds like its mandatory. Mountain rescue?”
</p><!--l. 15200--><p class="indent" >  She nods. “Maybe I should just send it.”
</p><!--l. 15202--><p class="indent" >  “Maybe you should.”
</p><!--l. 15204--><p class="indent" >  She smiles or grimaces, as if to say “sorry” with her teeth and pushes the button.
They will probably hang her for this, in some appropriate country, after she has been
sentences to hard labour for most of her life.
</p><!--l. 15208--><p class="indent" >  Some how things look bleak. Her body feels the bleakness. She feels . . .
bleak.
</p><!--l. 15210--><p class="indent" >  Vibe wearily pulls up the positions of the VeiVeks, while they are waiting, and sees
that they are still heading towards a few main cabins, close to the main mountain road.

It looks as though the French want to collect them and do a runner. They are retrieving
them and pulling out – without any consultation or consideration. That was not the
arrangement they were supposed to have. Betrayal. Not merely bleakness, but
mutiny.
</p><!--l. 15218--><p class="indent" >  They wait in tense silence for several long minutes. Then they hear a crack.
</p><!--l. 15221--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s it. He&#x2019;s down.”
</p><!--l. 15223--><p class="indent" >  “You shot him?” She looks shocked.
</p><!--l. 15225--><p class="indent" >  “Tranquilizer dart.”
</p><!--l. 15227--><p class="indent" >  “Elephant juice.”
</p><!--l. 15229--><p class="indent" >  Whatever kind of idiots the hooligans might be, the idea of death close by is more
than she wants to experience.
</p><!--l. 15232--><p class="indent" >  “Oh.”
</p><!--l. 15234--><p class="indent" >  “We might shoot bad buys in our spare time,” Frank says, waving his ﬁnger at her
mobile interface, “but in the real world, it costs too much”.
</p><!--l. 15237--><p class="indent" >  “Now we just have to do something with the body. The helicopter is too far
away. We&#x2019;ll have to package him and walk him out of here, unless he gives us
trouble.”
</p><!--l. 15241--><p class="indent" >  “That means we&#x2019;ll be oﬀ soon.”
</p><!--l. 15243--><p class="indent" >  “But that means I can go to Leirvassbu now. It must be the closest point to the road
for any of us?”
</p><!--l. 15246--><p class="indent" >  “But we don&#x2019;t know where the others are. We haven&#x2019;t searched that way
yet.”
</p><!--l. 15249--><p class="indent" >  “So isn&#x2019;t it a good time to do it?”
</p><!--l. 15251--><p class="indent" >  “We need to join Finn up there on the higher trail.”
</p><!--l. 15253--><p class="indent" >  “Okay, let&#x2019;s gather our things. Are you okay, Sara?”
</p><!--l. 15255--><p class="indent" >  She stares at him without answering him either verbally or non-verbally. “What if I
could help you to ﬁnd the last gang members?”
</p><!--l. 15259--><p class="indent" >  Smiles broaden their sunshine faces. “Oh no you don&#x2019;t.”
</p><!--l. 15261--><p class="indent" >  “But I have a network of little spies up here, with their own network, and they have
been little magnets for these assholes already.”
</p><!--l. 15264--><p class="indent" >  They look at one another. “Don&#x2019;t see what you could do.”
</p><!--l. 15266--><p class="indent" >  “Track them down for starters.”
</p><!--l. 15268--><p class="indent" >  “How?”
</p><!--l. 15270--><p class="indent" >  “I could start by asking them the last time they encountered someone. They are
programmed to register the passing hikers – it&#x2019;s our way of searching for intelligent
life in the national park.”
</p><!--l. 15274--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I think we can agree that that discounts ﬁnding any of our targets,” says the
local policeman.
</p><!--l. 15277--><p class="indent" >  “But you could see where there has been activity. It might give you a search
area.”
</p><!--l. 15281--><p class="indent" >  “Okay – tell us.”
</p><!--l. 15283--><p class="indent" >  “So I can stay?”
</p><!--l. 15285--><p class="indent" >  “I doubt it. No promises.”

</p><!--l. 15287--><p class="indent" >  “Tell us what you know ﬁrst, and then we&#x2019;ll talk about it.”
</p><!--l. 15289--><p class="indent" >  Vibe nods. “Don&#x2019;t suppose you have anything to drink? I&#x2019;m freezing.”
</p><!--l. 15291--><p class="indent" >  “Put some layers on and keep warm. Then follow me down to the main checkpoint.
You need to keep moving or you&#x2019;ll stiﬀen up.”

<!--l. 15303--><p class="indent" >  Vibe calls out to her little babies. She feels like some kind of goddess,
sending out her summons across the lands. Hark subjects! Your lady calls.
Little sparks of electromagnetic sermon hail the moist air in the mountain
valley.
</p><!--l. 15308--><p class="indent" >  Her coverage is not as good as before. She has lost contact with about a third of
them. Some must have moved out of range. That would never have happened without
the interference of The Adversary. Part of the Mars programming they are testing out
is to prevent them from moving too far apart for too long, so that they do not lose
contact with one another. Otherwise they could lose their way, or lose one another.
They should be small and numerous, and the general helpers should bind the experts
together. There are no geosynchronous satellites around Mars to join them together, or
to send them a positioning signal. The inﬁltrators of the God of War can not rely on an
umbilical.
</p><!--l. 15319--><p class="indent" >  Probably her panicked French team-mates, if that is indeed what she ought to
call them, have long since overridden such concerns. She needs line of sight
between all the VeiVeks for communications to work in an ad hoc relay mode.
Now that the transmitter is gone, there is no centralized relay point. Trying to
talk to them is essentially like spreading rumours. Say, have you seen X?
Don&#x2019;t know, I can only see Y and Z, I&#x2019;ll ask them. Can&#x2019;t see anyone else right

Yeah, baby.
</p><!--l. 15331--><p class="indent" >  Vibe maps the command program into her specs and blackens the lenses to cut out
the daylight. It will be quicker if she can tie into her VR interface. She can watch the
picture build up and go straight to the relevant data. It&#x2019;s all there. She has been
working on this for some time.

timing. At that distance, this will cost her her batteries. She should not stay on too
long. But it will be worth it. She is logging all of the data she receives from the little

</p><!--l. 15352--><p class="indent" >  –Tell me what you know, my subject.
</p><!--l. 15354--><p class="indent" >  –Ah, what can I say? I hear the hissing of the sun and stars in these microwave ears.
All is quiet here until your great voice hailed me to your service.
</p><!--l. 15357--><p class="indent" >  –Good, good, little friend. Tell me of any others.
</p><!--l. 15359--><p class="indent" >  –Ah, the eyes that last I saw in kind: my neighbour. Let me relay you to
him.
</p><!--l. 15361--><p class="indent" >  –Stand still friend. Let me stand on your giant shoulders that I might see farther.
And you, tell me subject, who have you seen?
</p><!--l. 15364--><p class="indent" >  –Greetings lady, I am the second. I have seen more. Not two hours past, I observed
a temperature anomaly – the tinge of warm ﬂesh – and a seismic tremor – the
thumping of boots on the hard ground. The signal of a communications beacon lit my
world, thundering against the song of sun and stars. I present you its captured ID as
my humble oﬀering.
</p><!--l. 15370--><p class="indent" >  The communion continues and is over within a matter of seconds. The positions of
the little robots have not altered signiﬁcantly. They cannot move very quickly across
the terrain, even with their advanced power sources. She can still reach a few of
them, but the others are in shadow of the mountains somewhere. She can talk
to ﬁve of her babies from this point. But that has already revealed useful
information.
</p><!--l. 15378--><p class="indent" >  The sensor logs for tourist encounters mostly date from several days ago. None of
the VeiVeks along the valley has seen anyone for some time, except for the second to
answer. That is what one would expect from a mountain that has been forcibly
quiescent. The VeiVeks she met a few days ago have moved out of range. She can just
read one behind her. She sees that it has been attacked with paint-balls, but that was
several days ago.
</p><!--l. 15386--><p class="indent" >  Vibe feels uplifting satisfaction at her own ability to see. This proves perhaps that
the VeiVeks can be useful in the mountains, in search and rescue operations, even here
on Earth. They have not been able to test this before, but she understands the
signiﬁcance of the result. And she will save the evidence for her thesis.
</p><!--l. 15392--><p class="indent" >  She saves the mobile ID inside a note and makes it ready for passing on to Frank
and his friend. She pulls oﬀ the glasses and packs them carefully into her
backpack.
</p><!--l. 15396--><p class="indent" >  In the distance, she hears the stomping of someone approaching. She rotates her
upper body and feels the numbness of her backside, on the cold rock. Frank is
coming.
</p><!--l. 15400--><p class="indent" >  “Get anything?”
</p><!--l. 15402--><p class="indent" >  “Actually, yes.”
</p><!--l. 15404--><p class="indent" >  “Really?”
</p><!--l. 15406--><p class="indent" >  “Are you impressed?” She grins.

</p><!--l. 15408--><p class="indent" >  He nods. “If it&#x2019;s true. It would be great.”
</p><!--l. 15410--><p class="indent" >  “Why wouldn&#x2019;t it be true?”
</p><!--l. 15412--><p class="indent" >  “Ah, sorry. I didn&#x2019;t mean it quite like that.”
</p><!--l. 15414--><p class="indent" >  His friend comes too, a little older, a little more jaded. “You have to tell us what
you found ﬁrst. Then we can decide if it&#x2019;s a lead we can use.”
</p><!--l. 15417--><p class="indent" >  “Okay.” She pulls oﬀ her wrist strap and ﬂattens it out across her knee. “Are you
ready to receive some data? I can send it broadcast.”
</p><!--l. 15420--><p class="indent" >  “Ugh, I&#x2019;m not sure we can accept data from civilians. . .”
</p><!--l. 15422--><p class="indent" >  “Yes we can,” Frank shows him. “Just go to Receive Evidence and open a
sandbox.”
</p><!--l. 15424--><p class="indent" >  “Okay.”
</p><!--l. 15426--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Don&#x2019;t they train these monkeys to use their bananas? </span>Vibe thinks.
</p><!--l. 15428--><p class="indent" >  “Okay – ready to receive.”
</p><!--l. 15430--><p class="indent" >  She transmits on short-range. A map and a mobile ID on the person she
detected.
</p><!--l. 15432--><p class="indent" >  “The sighting is a couple of hours old, so that gives you a search area, I
guess.”
</p><!--l. 15434--><p class="indent" >  “We could check it out.”
</p><!--l. 15436--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s not that far away.”
</p><!--l. 15438--><p class="indent" >  Frank grins. “I can check where the &#x2019;copter is.”
</p><!--l. 15440--><p class="indent" >  The other nods.
</p><!--l. 15442--><p class="indent" >  “How many more do we have to ﬁnd?”
</p><!--l. 15444--><p class="indent" >  “Based on the original surveillance, two more. It would be a big plus if we could
locate them quickly. We could ask the boss.”
</p><!--l. 15446--><p class="indent" >  Switch on the Voice That Gets You What You Want. “You know, if the helicopter
could give me a ride, I could contact all my babies much more quickly from the
air. . . The trouble is that the mountains shield my signal, and the range is
limited.”
</p><!--l. 15451--><p class="indent" >  “Your babies?”
</p><!--l. 15453--><p class="indent" >  “Robots.”
</p><!--l. 15455--><p class="indent" >  “Right.”
</p><!--l. 15457--><p class="indent" >  The oﬃcers&#x2019; eyes question one another, attempting to switch their minds to
comprehension and trust. Busy day, too much to process. Cold and damp. The thought
lingers, broken oﬀ by a nod. “I suppose I can ask. Let me see if I can reach the
command car.” The other wags a lingering nod and moves oﬀ to make a
call.
</p><!--l. 15462--><p class="indent" >  Frank risks a prototypical smile. “So you&#x2019;re going to save us?”
</p><!--l. 15464--><p class="indent" >  She shrugs. “I&#x2019;ll do what I can.”
</p><!--l. 15466--><p class="indent" >  He smiles and steps away over the stones, leaving her standing there, sending her a
look without even looking at her. She feels it burning into her humility. Shy boy. He
likes her.
</p><!--l. 15470--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Goddamn you, Peter Green. Why can&#x2019;t you rescue me from my agony? </span>Why is she
still hanging on to that idea?

</p><!--l. 15473--><p class="indent" >  Her rear end plops down onto a stone, half in a huﬀ and half in exhaustion. Around
her, sheer tonnage of rock impresses its stature on the land. She feels as though she
could be transformed into this landscape, if she remains here. She is small and weak
and tired. Eggs lake. Head hurts.
</p><!--l. 15479--><p class="indent" >  For a moment she forgets even the mobile that clasps her body with its technopathic
tethers. She could dial comfort and understanding in a heartbeat, but she just feels
weary.
</p><!--l. 15483--><p class="indent" >  After a short recess, the other comes back.
</p><!--l. 15485--><p class="indent" >  “Sara!”
</p><!--l. 15487--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah.”
</p><!--l. 15489--><p class="indent" >  “Tap in to this call.”
</p><!--l. 15491--><p class="indent" >  She surfaces and touches her tie-in sequence. An image appear in her glasses. It
seems to be from within the command car. Some police oﬃcer.
</p><!--l. 15494--><p class="indent" >  “Sara Stensrud?”
</p><!--l. 15496--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s me.”
</p><!--l. 15498--><p class="indent" >  “My name is detective sergeant Myhre. I hear you want to help us.”
</p><!--l. 15500--><p class="indent" >  “If I can.”
</p><!--l. 15502--><p class="indent" >  “You have some kind of robots with cameras.”
</p><!--l. 15504--><p class="indent" >  “Not exactly, more like sensors. But they are designed to detect people.”
</p><!--l. 15506--><p class="indent" >  “And you think you can ﬁnd our stragglers?”
</p><!--l. 15508--><p class="indent" >  She nods. “Maybe.”
</p><!--l. 15510--><p class="indent" >  “The oﬃcer says you need the chopper?”
</p><!--l. 15512--><p class="indent" >  “It would give me better access to my robots. We are in communications shadow.
They only have a short range ad hoc net right now. Someone took away our relay
transmitter.”
</p><!--l. 15516--><p class="indent" >  “Tell me about these robots.”
</p><!--l. 15518--><p class="indent" >  She draws a slow breath. “It&#x2019;s a research project, it&#x2019;s registered. Look it
up.”
</p><!--l. 15521--><p class="indent" >  “I already have. I see a mountain watcher project.”
</p><!--l. 15523--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s part of it.”
</p><!--l. 15525--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m checking your ID but I cannot see that you are registered with this mountain
watcher project. . .”
</p><!--l. 15528--><p class="indent" >  “I should be there, but I am not a primary team member. That&#x2019;s just the French and
the Americans. . .”
</p><!--l. 15531--><p class="indent" >  “No, I can&#x2019;t see anything here. Wait a minute.”
</p><!--l. 15533--><p class="indent" >  The line goes dead for a second and then cuts back in.
</p><!--l. 15535--><p class="indent" >  “All right, we found you. A Sara Vibeke Stensrud.”
</p><!--l. 15537--><p class="indent" >  “C&#x2019;est moi.”
</p><!--l. 15539--><p class="indent" >  “All right. They tell me that you have possibly identiﬁed the location of the
stragglers.”
</p><!--l. 15542--><p class="indent" >  “I have a probable sighting.”
</p><!--l. 15544--><p class="indent" >  “We are checking it out now.”
</p><!--l. 15546--><p class="indent" >  “Cool.”

</p><!--l. 15548--><p class="indent" >  “If it checks out, we might be interested in your information.”
</p><!--l. 15550--><p class="indent" >  “Okay.”
</p><!--l. 15552--><p class="indent" >  “I suggest that you listen carefully to these oﬃcers and do as you&#x2019;re told.”
</p><!--l. 15555--><p class="indent" >  She nods, but does not say anything. She is expecting an earful, but it doesn&#x2019;t
come.
</p><!--l. 15558--><p class="indent" >  “If they can have seen anyone, they can tell me. That allows you to either eliminate
some areas or pin-point when and where they were.”
</p><!--l. 15561--><p class="indent" >  “All right, let&#x2019;s give it a try.”
</p><!--l. 15564--><p class="indent" >  “Could you tell me something?”
</p><!--l. 15566--><p class="indent" >  “Yes?”
</p><!--l. 15568--><p class="indent" >  “Is there a Peter Green registered with the current team?”
</p><!--l. 15570--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t know. Is there a problem?”
</p><!--l. 15572--><p class="indent" >  “Good question. Never mind.”
</p><!--l. 15574--><p class="indent" >  “All right, I&#x2019;ll leave you in the hand of the duty oﬃcers.” He cuts out.
</p><!--l. 15577--><p class="indent" >  The other says: “Okay, let&#x2019;s get moving. Can you walk okay?”
</p><!--l. 15580--><p class="indent" >  “I think so.”
</p><!--l. 15582--><p class="indent" >  “Good. Then we should get started before you stiﬀen up.”

</p><!--l. 15592--><p class="indent" >  “Ahh. Next question.”
</p><!--l. 15594--><p class="indent" >  “Is anything wrong?”
</p><!--l. 15596--><p class="indent" >  She explains.
</p><!--l. 15598--><p class="indent" >  “And you&#x2019;re stuck without access to your work? I&#x2019;m so sorry, honey. How
frustrating!”
</p><!--l. 15600--><p class="indent" >  “Actually, they want me to help them catch some low life football hooligans that are
surﬁng on your taxes.”
</p><!--l. 15603--><p class="indent" >  “Sounds important.”
</p><!--l. 15605--><p class="indent" >  “I want to work on my project.”

proud.”

but it&#x2019;s something to live by.”
</p><!--l. 15615--><p class="indent" >  “What about my degree?”
</p><!--l. 15617--><p class="indent" >  “Your degree can wait. What happens in the real world is more important. Besides,
in my experience any experience is good experience. It will all help you in the

<!--l. 15634--><p class="indent" >  A helicopter comes. Spiralling air lifts them into a place of open clarity. The rocks
lose their sharpness and she fades away from nature into an urban dullness that haunts
the inside the cabin. Civilization has intruded into her escape. It feels like a
disappointment.
</p><!--l. 15640--><p class="indent" >  The girl is weary, dizzy and nauseous. The helicopter ride seems to be
wrenching at her body, speaking diﬀerently to her skin and to her guts. She feels
out of synch, out of place. The dizziness seems to extend to a sharp pain in
her ears, which slides down a tense muscle to her throat. Everything feels
wrong.
</p><!--l. 15646--><p class="indent" >  Even as she sits, the world becomes greyer and more hostile. Colours are losing
their ﬂavours, and sounds only hurt. She feels as a bucket of water must feel in the
hands of a running window-cleaner. She only hopes that he does not fall oﬀ his
ladder.
</p><!--l. 15651--><p class="indent" >  “So what can you see?” a voice says.
</p><!--l. 15653--><p class="indent" >  They are talking to her. She would turn to face the voice, but the disorientation
presides over her faculties. A recollection of looking for people surfaces and she looks
down at her mobile. There it is, a little larger and heavier than usual. Or is it her hands
that are larger?
</p><!--l. 15659--><p class="indent" >  “Sara?”
</p><!--l. 15661--><p class="indent" >  She focuses on the mobile. The interface is alive; she knows what to do, and yet her
body is sluggish and unresponsive.
</p><!--l. 15664--><p class="indent" >  “Sara? Are you okay?”
</p><!--l. 15666--><p class="indent" >  A map of the mountains appears and she sees the remnants of her little tribe of
babies. They are a rag-tag bunch now, barely cooperating — just ﬂeeing the scene,
like rats responding to a rogue harlequin. All she can think of is how she has been
betrayed by the research team and how she will no longer be able to complete her
research. The reason is no longer important. It is only the knowledge of it that
matters.
</p><!--l. 15674--><p class="indent" >  The helicopter makes a turn, swinging them around, slopping soapy water out of
her bucket. She feels a shiver through her very soul.
</p><!--l. 15677--><p class="indent" >  “Sara?”
</p><!--l. 15679--><p class="indent" >  “Yes?”
</p><!--l. 15681--><p class="indent" >  “You don&#x2019;t look very well. Try to concentrate on the mountains.”

</p><!--l. 15683--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m . . . okay.”
</p><!--l. 15685--><p class="indent" >  But something tells her that she is not. She is not even sure why, she only knows
that she would like to go to sleep.
</p><!--l. 15688--><p class="indent" >  The world falls away as they pass over a mountain. She attempts to connect to her
babies once again. She can see a few more now, but they seem to be spinning around
and her hands are too big to work the controls of her mobile.
</p><!--l. 15693--><p class="indent" >  I am sick, she thinks. This is what it is like to be sick. As a child she can recall lying
in bed with a feverish mirage before her – like a galaxy of swirling dust, full of pins
and needles, rotating in front of her. An astral shield, keeping her in her bed. If she
tried to rise, it would push her down again. It was a frightening experience then, now
she can feel the same sensations returning, as if some old ghost from a childish
nightmare has returned to taunt her.
</p><!--l. 15701--><p class="indent" >  “Sara, look at me.”.
</p><!--l. 15703--><p class="indent" >  There is that voice again. Why can&#x2019;t she turn her head? Is it the dream where she is
paralyzed? Is she asleep now?
</p><!--l. 15706--><p class="indent" >  She feels a growing fear, an anxiety. Something is wrong. It is not possible to put a
ﬁnger on what it is. It is simply growing like a culture of disease, eating into her. The
only thing she can remember is that she is going to fail her doctorate, that
her work is doomed and that they are after her. When they catch her it is
going to be bad. She needs to run, but that is not going to happen any time
soon.
</p><!--l. 15713--><p class="indent" >  Sleep is what she needs.
</p><!--l. 15715--><p class="indent" >  Sleep.
</p><!--l. 15717--><p class="indent" >  As metal blades lunge at the frozen air beyond their cocoon, the sound of
conquered sky thunders above her; emptiness felled by the whirling blade. It tramples
her senses into oblivious denial.
</p><!--l. 15721--><p class="indent" >  And, without her realizing it, darkness comes.

</p><!--l. 15727--><p class="indent" >  The pitter-pattering of wintery rain splashes onto his window. It is hypnotic,
distracting. It is as though nature is trying to gain his attention, trying to communicate
with him in Morse code.
</p><!--l. 15731--><p class="indent" >  What is it trying to say?
</p><!--l. 15733--><p class="indent" >  You must be crazy, Dermot? What a loser Dermot?
</p><!--l. 15735--><p class="indent" >  His combo beeps the arrival of new mail. All around him, little streams of
communication are pleading with his senses, vying for is attention. Look at
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">me</span>!
</p><!--l. 15739--><p class="indent" >  He shakes his head free of its involuntary ruminations and looks for his tea. He is
beginning to get a headache and tea is high in salicylic salts; it is natural aspirin. He
ﬂicks his kettle on in preparation.
</p><!--l. 15744--><p class="indent" >  Beyond his window, silver birches are waving a muted dance as they cling
precariously onto balding foliage. Something metal clanks loudly, blown over in a
guest of wind and penetrates the sound barrier. It is at times like this that Dermot feels
safest, viewing the world from behind a glass membrane, in warm denial of its chilly
bite. He browses forth some classical music and ﬁnds new energy from his glance
though the pane.
</p><!--l. 15752--><p class="indent" >  What is he doing here anyway? He has seldom felt so out of place. He ought to
be working on Bishop&#x2019;s project. Why did he ever agree to it? That&#x2019;s easy
to answer: because he is weak. He cannot say no, but he cannot just do it
either.
</p><!--l. 15757--><p class="indent" >  And Bishop trusts him to do it. That makes him feel a little bad, but then he more or
less forced it on him. Make me a pathogen, Dermot. Where are the ethics? There are
players all over the game who have paid to kill and maim and be lawless, and he wants
to tell them all that they are morally bankrupt and that they should all hail the
police as the saviours of society? Why should he be the one to trick them? It&#x2019;s
dishonest.
</p><!--l. 15764--><p class="indent" >  On the other hand, he can see a certain sense to it. He cannot stand violence in the

real world—outside the game. People are getting dangerous now. Like those Nazi
assholes. There are bad people all over.
</p><!--l. 15769--><p class="indent" >  They&#x2019;ve got griefers messing up their game scenarios in the sims to pot—but
that is not the same thing as having the evangelical churches manipulate
the games for their own gain. That&#x2019;s brainwashing. And what was the latest
thing he heard? The Russian maﬁa moving in on the technology for extortion
purposes? Christ. He doesn&#x2019;t know what to think, and he doesn&#x2019;t know what to
do.
</p><!--l. 15776--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">So why don&#x2019;t I just do as I&#x2019;m told?</span>
</p><!--l. 15778--><p class="indent" >  Maybe because he doesn&#x2019;t know whose judgement to trust. I <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">am </span>a loser, he thinks.
Won&#x2019;t listen, won&#x2019;t do, just mind my own business. And that means nothing. I don&#x2019;t
have any business. I&#x2019;m just a kid. A stupid juvenile. That means I just hide when I
don&#x2019;t know what to do.
</p><!--l. 15783--><p class="indent" >  He makes his tea and slurps its hot essence down a dry throat. Back to the
window.
</p><!--l. 15786--><p class="indent" >  The ground outside is now a slushy mixture of melting snow. Not long ago this was
a delicate whip of pure white crystals. Now the crust at the roadside is a black cement
of car emissions, dirt and water. The janitor has tried to make little piles of leaves,
neatly placed into object-oriented piles. What is the point of making these attempts at
keeping order? The wind keeps on messing them up. Even the household waste is
neatly separated into metal, glass, organic. . . but people are too lazy to check
properly. It gets mixed.
</p><!--l. 15795--><p class="indent" >  Law and order for leaves? It doesn&#x2019;t work.
</p><!--l. 15797--><p class="indent" >  He senses a sigh forming, deep inside his being. Better suppress that. There is not
sense in crying over things that can&#x2019;t be controlled. Force majeur, act of god.
There is no point in having a law unless you can enforce it. It costs to enforce
order.
</p><!--l. 15802--><p class="indent" >  It&#x2019;s all a waste of time. It&#x2019;s a jungle out there.
</p><!--l. 15804--><p class="indent" >  They can&#x2019;t keep anything separated: not out there, not in here. The failure is not in
the objects, he thinks but in the operations and channels between them. The forces that
link them together. . .
</p><!--l. 15808--><p class="indent" >  Hey, wait. The channels. Maybe that&#x2019;s it.
</p><!--l. 15811--><p class="indent" >  Mind returns to the programming task. The game is just as complicated as the
world outside. It&#x2019;s just that when things go crazy, they call it an error instead of an act
of god. And he is the janitor of the Lord of the game, cleaning up these little fragile
piles of leaves and blow around in such a storm.
</p><!--l. 15817--><p class="indent" >  What a loser, Dermot.
</p><!--l. 15819--><p class="indent" >  All right. Integration of the objects is the key to stability. That means that every
prehistoric XML pipe between them is a potential point of failure. But does that mean
that isolation, separatism, objectization is fundamentally the source of the
error? No. That is just housekeeping. The interrelationships are the key to
stability. That is where the problem is. Small services are ﬁne with lightweight
coordination.

</p><!--l. 15826--><p class="indent" >  He feels a surge of satisfaction at the insight.
</p><!--l. 15828--><p class="indent" >  Then there is this other thing. They have adopted such a rigid object model for
programming that it is inﬂexible. You just can&#x2019;t do that. You can&#x2019;t backtrack either,
they&#x2019;ve spent way too much time investing in this model. It would cost too much time
and money. If they are going to change anything here, some other approach will be
needed. Something like social engineering.
</p><!--l. 15835--><p class="indent" >  The ways that modern programs are written, with their closed architecture,
standardized objects means that every game in the world will now inherit the same
class of methods. Inﬁltrating game software with cheap subliminal rendering tricks is
now trivial. Before you know what has happened, entertainment is not the main
channel for mind control.
</p><!--l. 15842--><p class="indent" >  That is what the Indian girl said essentially: they cannot ﬁx the problems of the
game easily because it would mean change for everyone. Everything is controlled
from one place. A house of cards built on a sturdy but bad idea.
</p><!--l. 15847--><p class="indent" >  Weary of the triviality of his options, Dermot puts the coding problem aside. He
ﬁgures that he will sort it out tomorrow now. The crucial insight has been made; that
is enough to put his mind at rest.
</p><!--l. 15852--><p class="indent" >  On the desk, a copy of TIME magazine is lying opened at a signiﬁcant page. He has
been meaning to read that article for some time now — it is the story that blew open
the rumours of the U.S. government&#x2019;s involvement in the game. He should read it.
Bishop gave it to him. He was supposed to read it, to convince him of the usefulness
of what they are doing. Little does he understand yet that he is wasting his time on a
misﬁt.
</p><!--l. 15859--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I don&#x2019;t even care</span>, he realizes. Bishop&#x2019;s arguments are all well and good, but Dermot
is not in the right place to invest emotional currency in a faceless problem of
supernatural proportions. Soon, it will be his compulsory day at the crime centre once
again. It pays well, but his heart is not in it. There seem to be more pressing matters
for him to deal with: like getting his life sorted, like getting laid, maybe even just
getting high once. All this Christian propaganda business seems just a little above his
head.
</p><!--l. 15868--><p class="indent" >  Can it really be as important as they are making it out to be? It&#x2019;s like talking about
the end of the world or something. Wouldn&#x2019;t they have seen some kind of
sign?
</p><!--l. 15872--><p class="indent" >  And then there is the girl. He is not sure what to make of this girl, Prima or
whatever her name is. She is smart, there&#x2019;s no doubt about that, but she has the feeling
of someone self-taught who doesn&#x2019;t quite know the right things to say. On the other
hand, that&#x2019;s cool though. And she&#x2019;s pretty. Very pretty. But not exactly his
type.
</p><!--l. 15878--><p class="indent" >  Loser, Dermot.
</p><!--l. 15880--><p class="indent" >  As for the others. They mainly notice him when he cannot deliver on time, or if he
is absent or sick. Even his father, whom he tried to visit once, treated him like a ghost.
Receiving him was more of a duty to be dispatched than a caring. Once he went to
visit the old man after promising to visit for a long time. When he ﬁnally arrived his

father sat him immediately down at the kitchen table where a single place was set and
presented him with an overcooked dinner plate. One knife, one fork and burned
chicken. Then he announced that he was going out to meet a friend and would be back
in a couple of hours.
</p><!--l. 15890--><p class="indent" >  It is probably his own fault. He has never been very good at ﬁtting in. Well, it&#x2019;s too
late now, unfortunately.

<!--l. 15897--><p class="indent" >  Bishop. Now there&#x2019;s a strange kettle of ﬁsh. The other day, Dermot heard him
talking on his mobile, in the oﬃce down the hall, audio only. It was as though a
diﬀerent person had crawled out of him, ripping the latex mask from his
face.
</p><!--l. 15902--><p class="indent" >  “Hi Cato.”
</p><!--l. 15904--><p class="indent" >  “Ed.”
</p><!--l. 15906--><p class="indent" >  “How&#x2019;s Treena, the kids?”
</p><!--l. 15908--><p class="indent" >  “She&#x2019;s ﬁne. They&#x2019;re all ﬁne.”
</p><!--l. 15910--><p class="indent" >  “What&#x2019;s it been now? Twenty-ﬁve years?”
</p><!--l. 15912--><p class="indent" >  “Something like that.”
</p><!--l. 15914--><p class="indent" >  “Got your health?”
</p><!--l. 15916--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m all right. Not so bad. How about you?”
</p><!--l. 15918--><p class="indent" >  A married man. Bishop is a married man. He has lived with, probably slept with, a
woman for twenty-ﬁve years. They have kids. Is this the same man? If envy were a
reaction to shattered illusion, it would ﬂow out if him. Instead, Dermot feels shame
and humility. It is so far from his life. It is what everyone was supposed to do in those
days, maybe even now. When was it that people stopped getting together like
that?
</p><!--l. 15926--><p class="indent" >  “I suppose you big-wigs are all busy up there?”
</p><!--l. 15928--><p class="indent" >  “Always busy, yes.”
</p><!--l. 15930--><p class="indent" >  As the conversation scraped to a close, arrested by its own friction, Dermot walked
up the hall to look at Bishop—just to check that it really is him. Bishop usually
broadcasts an outward authority. There, in that moment, he was simply small,
an ordinary man. He saw Dermot looking, nodded, and went back to his
business.
</p><!--l. 15937--><p class="indent" >  Dermot prefers not think about his childhood. All he can really remember is being
disinterested in other kids and their families. His family was always distant. It suited
him just ﬁne.

<!--l. 15947--><p class="indent" >  Henrik walks by his desk in the open oﬃce landscape, dressed in purple tights and
a yellow corduroy jacket. His showy oﬃce-mate dresses up as a diﬀerent person each
day. Some bizarre game of his own with role playing. He probably has some serious
personality conﬂict.

</p><!--l. 15964--><p class="indent" >  Henrik says: “No one you meet is ever who they seem to be. When the aliens sent
their robots so that they wouldn&#x2019;t be exposed to danger. We misunderstood. We
thought that&#x2019;s what the aliens looked like.”
</p><!--l. 15968--><p class="indent" >  Right.
</p><!--l. 15971--><p class="indent" >  The phone rings again. He cannot recall when he had had so many calls in such a
shot space of time. He is not normally a centre of attention.
</p><!--l. 15975--><p class="indent" >  “Hi. This is Christina. I don&#x2019;t know if you remember me, but we met on the
tube.”
</p><!--l. 15978--><p class="indent" >  He starts.
</p><!--l. 15980--><p class="indent" >  And stops.
</p><!--l. 15982--><p class="indent" >  And recalls the slight girl, with a smart, slim skirt and shoulder length blond hair,
who had deigned to speak to him. She seemed nervous, even fearful. Her fear had
made him feel almost conﬁdent, as though he had had an advantage over her—a
woman—for once in his life.
</p><!--l. 15987--><p class="indent" >  “I remember!” he says. “Good to hear from you.” (But why are you calling a loser
like me?) “I never though you&#x2019;d call.” No don&#x2019;t say that. It sounds pathetic. Shit.
Fuck!
</p><!--l. 15991--><p class="indent" >  “I thought maybe you could help me with my combo. You know, you said you did
computer stuﬀ.”
</p><!--l. 15994--><p class="indent" >  Dermot listens, incredulous. She is asking him to help her with a computer. That is
about the only thing in the world that he knows something about—where he might
actually have something to oﬀer her.
</p><!--l. 15999--><p class="indent" >  “Your combo? What&#x2019;s wrong with it?”
</p><!--l. 16001--><p class="indent" >  “It sort of stopped working. I was in a room chatting and it just packed in. It was
pretty embarrassing. I was in the middle of this really hot conversation.”
</p><!--l. 16005--><p class="indent" >  He thanks as many gods as he can remember.
</p><!--l. 16007--><p class="indent" >  “The name on the doorbell is Grorud. There&#x2019;s no ﬁrst name. Make sure you hold it
in for a while. I might not hear it.”
</p><!--l. 16010--><p class="indent" >  “Okay.”
</p><!--l. 16012--><p class="indent" >  “See you.” She hangs up.

</p><!--l. 16014--><p class="indent" >  He is left staring into space. His heart is pounding faster than the last time he rode
his bike up to the forest. He begins to regret the burgers he has been knocking back in
the last couple of weeks since the project shifted up a notch. Shit! The project . . . He
really needs to work on debugging this code.
</p><!--l. 16020--><p class="indent" >  He toys with the idea of calling her back, but then he realizes that he cannot call her
back. She has his number, but he does not have hers.
</p><!--l. 16024--><p class="indent" >  Bishop&#x2019;s ghost haunts him. “Dermot, have to step up the pace of our counter-operation.
My sources are saying that there is going to be a major intelligence operation in the
game within a couple of weeks.”
</p><!--l. 16028--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m kind of busy right now.”
</p><!--l. 16030--><p class="indent" >  “Dermot, look at me. This is not a time to be busy.”
</p><!--l. 16032--><p class="indent" >  Something sinks inside him. Bishop looks stern. He is not his usual congenial self.
It must be something important. But what has it got to do with him? No one made him
saviour of the world.
</p><!--l. 16036--><p class="indent" >  “We all have to contribute here, Dermot. I&#x2019;m relying on you.”
</p><!--l. 16038--><p class="indent" >  The words chill him. Bishop is relying on him? but he forced him into this in the
ﬁrst place. Who said this was his responsibility? Here I am just trying to live my
life, and you come in here bossing me around like you have some kind of
authority. What you don&#x2019;t realize is that I&#x2019;m just an ordinary person, not
some superhero. You can&#x2019;t expect everyone to care about this stupid political
agenda.
</p><!--l. 16045--><p class="indent" >  “Okay,” he says. “Will do.” The feeling in his torso tells him that he has no real
intention of trying to comply with the request. For a moment, this dishonesty disturbs
him, but on momentary reﬂection he resigns to it and pigeon-holes the worry into the
usual slot. Basically he is an unreliable loser. He knows it, and everyone else knows it.
He doesn&#x2019;t need Bishop to rub his nose in it. He is not about to spend time stressing
over this problem.
</p><!--l. 16053--><p class="indent" >  He suppresses the emotion. He cannot cope with all of his weaknesses. So push it
under the rug and let someone else deal with it. He has done it so many times
before.

</p><!--l. 16058--><p class="noindent" >*</p></div>
<!--l. 16062--><p class="indent" >  It is getting dark early now. He emerges from the cinema some time later. As he
walks through the centre he feels self-conscious. This is the heart of the red-light
district.
</p><!--l. 16066--><p class="indent" >  Suddenly he turns, staring sharply into an alley. For a moment he is certain that he
has seen a couple having sex there, in the snow. Is he mistaken? He stares into damp
vapour. There is nothing there.
</p><!--l. 16071--><p class="indent" >  He ﬁnds her ﬂat in a side street unworthy of mention in one of the older parts of

town. From the directions she gave him, he has to walk up and down the street a
couple of times to ﬁnd the entrance to the block. The buildings are not numbered very
well here.
</p><!--l. 16076--><p class="indent" >  He ﬁnds a small staircase leading up from the street to a sheltered porch with a
panel of door buzzers. This is not the classiest of places. The names are all
written by hand on bits of sticky labels that are several layers thick. He ﬁnds
one that says Grorud, but checks the others in case there are several. It is
not exactly an uncommon name. There seem to be no others so he pushes
the button. As he pushes the button for a second time, a small voice says,
“Yes?”
</p><!--l. 16084--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s me – Dermot,” he says uncomfortably into the metal grill.
</p><!--l. 16086--><p class="indent" >  There is a pause. “Oh yeah. Come to the end of the ﬁrst ﬂoor.”
</p><!--l. 16088--><p class="indent" >  The door opener buzzes and he fumbles with the old reinforced glass door. It
wouldn&#x2019;t stop a thief, he thinks. Its wooden frame is almost rotten. It has probably
been there since the 1970s judging from the style. The quality of the lock is not much
to write home about either; he could probably have pushed it open without
her consent, but who cares? He should not be judgemental about her living
conditions. After all, she had looked pretty demure when he met her on the
tram.
</p><!--l. 16097--><p class="indent" >  He enters the building and paces down a long corridor, past an elevator and
stairwell, that reminds him of a hospital. It is utterly featureless in the corridor. The
doors look like the kind of cardboard doors they use in public buildings, all identical
and free of decoration. They have a thin veneer of fake wood on them, but he knows
that they are just paper thin. Each door has a little round peep hole to inspect
callers.
</p><!--l. 16105--><p class="indent" >  As he reaches the end of the corridor, the last door pushes open. It opens outwards.
Strange, he thinks. It is almost as though this really were a hospital once. Or maybe an
old people&#x2019;s home. He waits for her to open it, but it just opens a crack. After a
moment he knocks and pulls the door cautiously wider. There is no one there, but a
small voice says “Come in”.
</p><!--l. 16112--><p class="indent" >  Dermot steps inside, his heart beating faster again. There is too much blood in his
head now. He starts to feel dizzy and he cannot quite focus. Looking through the small
entrance wardrobe, he sees her sitting on a sofa in front of the TV. The room is messy
and stinks of some kind of smoke. It looks as though no one has cleaned here for
weeks or more. There are toys on the ﬂoor. A child has been here. The room is thick
with old stale air.
</p><!--l. 16120--><p class="indent" >  She stands up nonchalantly as he enters and smiles coyly. She is beautiful, he
thinks, but she has that tired look about her, like someone who smokes and does
drugs. She is skinny. He likes that too.
</p><!--l. 16124--><p class="indent" >  “I wasn&#x2019;t sure if you&#x2019;d come,” she says. She does not look at him as she says the
words, instead she walks to a small kitchen and starts routing around in some old
dishes for cups. He watches her thin body move in a pair of light blue jeans and
narrow black polo-neck. The clothes look old, but they reveal her small breast and

buttocks and her long thin legs. He cannot help from looking at her. She is
perfect.
</p><!--l. 16131--><p class="indent" >  “I said I would,” he manages.
</p><!--l. 16133--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t get many visitors,” she says. “Shall I make tea? I think I have some. It&#x2019;s
probably still all right.”
</p><!--l. 16136--><p class="indent" >  He nods. “Yes, please. Tea&#x2019;s ﬁne.”
</p><!--l. 16138--><p class="indent" >  She nods without emotion, acknowledging that now she has to wash two cups from
the pile of plates and crockery in her kitchen sink. She rattles around for a while and
he hears a kettle start to roar.
</p><!--l. 16142--><p class="indent" >  He starts to look around as she works. The TV is showing some kind of junk show.
He doesn&#x2019;t bother to look at it. The remote control is placed strategically on the arm of
the sofa where she was sitting. She has a single shelf with some old books and what
looks like a bedroom dressing table with a computer combo on it. It looks old,
probably ﬁve years old. He cannot remember having seen anything like it for what
seems like ages.
</p><!--l. 16150--><p class="indent" >  He scans the room. On one wall she has two small black and white pictures of what
look like death-metal bands. Someone in the pictures looks a bit like her. She turns
and hangs in the kitchen doorway, watching him look around without ever really
looking at him. She does not smile or show any kind of emotion. He wonders if she is
taking something now.
</p><!--l. 16157--><p class="indent" >  “Is that you?”
</p><!--l. 16159--><p class="indent" >  She shuﬄes into the room, glancing at him brieﬂy for the ﬁrst time and smiles
slightly without opening her lips.
</p><!--l. 16162--><p class="indent" >  “I used to hang with them.”
</p><!--l. 16164--><p class="indent" >  Dermot&#x2019;s musical taste has always been quite heavy. He oscillates between dark
classical motifs like Shostakovich or Honegger and heavy rock bands. But these guys
look more hard core than he would normally listen to. They have this whole death
thing going on.
</p><!--l. 16170--><p class="indent" >  “I used to hang out in that crowd before I moved here.”
</p><!--l. 16172--><p class="indent" >  “On crosses?” he says, “Like Jesus?”
</p><!--l. 16174--><p class="indent" >  She laughs, or almost. There was at least a smile there for a moment that seemed
genuine. Dermot feels immediately more at ease, pleased with himself for making a
joke.
</p><!--l. 16178--><p class="indent" >  “You moved? Where from?”
</p><!--l. 16180--><p class="indent" >  “Up North. I would hang out with this band, get stoned. It was about the only thing
worth doing there.” She points to one of the painted faces adorned with straight black
hair. “He was the bass player. They used to have me in the room when they were
practising.”
</p><!--l. 16185--><p class="indent" >  Dermot feels instantly a pang of envy. He cannot imagine what it must be like to
meet people like this. He imagines that it must be dangerous. There must be
something wrong with people like that, right? “So he was your boyfriend?” he
mutters, trying to sound as though he doesn&#x2019;t care.
</p><!--l. 16191--><p class="indent" >  “We used to fuck”

</p><!--l. 16193--><p class="indent" >  He nods, ﬁghting a bolt of panic, unnerved by a word which looms too
largely in his mind. He fumbles to continue his nonchalance. “So. . .what
happened?”
</p><!--l. 16197--><p class="indent" >  “He left me cause I was a bitch.” She says it with almost complete dispassion, an
even lack of emotion. She puﬀs on her cigarette. Dermot has hardly ever seen
a cigarette before, except in old movies. He is not quite sure what to say
now.
</p><!--l. 16202--><p class="indent" >  “Doesn&#x2019;t that make you sad? No regrets?”
</p><!--l. 16204--><p class="indent" >  She shrugs.
</p><!--l. 16206--><p class="indent" >  “So you need a new boyfriend then,” he jokes, ﬁshing for information.
</p><!--l. 16208--><p class="indent" >  She shrugs and inhales long and hard on the cigarette, wincing, almost as though in
pain.
</p><!--l. 16211--><p class="indent" >  “Or a lover? Everyone needs someone.”
</p><!--l. 16213--><p class="indent" >  “Not me.” She stares out of the window. The suddenly, she seems to tire of the
subject and goes over to the combo and switches it on.
</p><!--l. 16216--><p class="indent" >  “This is what happens,” she says simply.
</p><!--l. 16218--><p class="indent" >  Dermot watches the screen. It starts to light up, changing colour a couple of times
and then suddenly it stops.

</p>
  <div class="verbatim" id="verbatim-5">
Controller Error.

<!--l. 16222--><p class="nopar" > No kidding, Dermot thinks.
</p><!--l. 16225--><p class="indent" >  “Probably some kind of memory error,” he says.
</p><!--l. 16227--><p class="indent" >  She looks at him expectantly.
</p><!--l. 16229--><p class="indent" >  “I only use it for VR. I like the chat rooms. I like ﬂirting with men, making them
horny.”
</p><!--l. 16232--><p class="indent" >  Dermot reels, trying focus on the combo while his mind is pressing him to focus on
her behind. He uses a special key combination to ﬂip the combo into debug mode and
starts it up again. She watches him without apparent interest, but with an almost
judgemental dispassion. She is watching how he performs, he thinks. I am a lab
rat.
</p><!--l. 16238--><p class="indent" >  He wonders if she really wants him to ﬁx it, or whether this was just a reason for
making contact. In spite of her demure look, she seems reclusive and lonely. It makes
him like her instantly, but there is something a bit odd about her. Under diﬀerent
circumstances he might have walked away, but she is fascinating, almost
exotic.
</p><!--l. 16244--><p class="indent" >  She turns suddenly and goes into the kitchen. After a moment she brings back tea,
puts it onto the coﬀee table and sits down in front of the TV as though he is no longer
there.
</p><!--l. 16248--><p class="indent" >  He ﬁddles with the combo for a while longer to make sure there is not something
trivial wrong then, seeing that she is no longer interested, gives in. “I don&#x2019;t think I can
do anything with this now,” he says, not really sure that she cares anymore. “But I
might be able to ﬁnd something at work.”
</p><!--l. 16254--><p class="indent" >  “Doesn&#x2019;t matter. I just thought you might know.”
</p><!--l. 16256--><p class="indent" >  Dermot feels puzzled but dares not show it. Her diﬃculty almost puts him at ease.
She is way weirder than he is. He is just dull, but she is . . . messed up somehow.
Obviously something has made her this way. He is intrigued and entranced by her pale
beauty. Ensnared.
</p><!--l. 16261--><p class="indent" >  There is only a single two seater sofa, so he sits down beside her. “Is this
mine?”
</p><!--l. 16264--><p class="indent" >  She nods, still not making eye contact. “Sugar?” She points to a bag pushed into a
half-dead pot plant on the table.
</p><!--l. 16267--><p class="indent" >  “No. It&#x2019;s ﬁne.”
</p><!--l. 16269--><p class="indent" >  He sits back in the sofa. It is a little too soft and a little too narrow so that he feels
as though he is lying next to her. His leg brushes against hers.
</p><!--l. 16273--><p class="indent" >  “So you probably have a girlfriend.”
</p><!--l. 16275--><p class="indent" >  The big question. It is embarrassing to answer.
</p><!--l. 16277--><p class="indent" >  “No. Not right now.” <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Not ever dick head</span>. He feels a sinking feeling at the

acknowledgement.
</p><!--l. 16280--><p class="indent" >  “Oh. Why not?”
</p><!--l. 16282--><p class="indent" >  He ﬂounders. “I work too hard I suppose. Don&#x2019;t get out enough.”
</p><!--l. 16284--><p class="indent" >  Now she seems almost interested for a brief instant. “I got ﬁred today,” she says
matter of factly. “I&#x2019;m not very good with work. Can&#x2019;t keep a job.” He tries to make a
connection for a moment and then thinks better of it. “I spend too much time on VR.
It was great. We could be in there for hours while we were handling calls at the call
centre. I only wanted the job so that I could use their combos. The boss caught us and
warned us about it twice, me and the girl I worked with. He only ﬁred me
though.”
</p><!--l. 16293--><p class="indent" >  Dermot examines her critically now. Is there anything going on in her head? he
wonders. She could be in a diﬀerent world, mailing telegrams to him. He is not even
sure if he is really communicating with her. Perhaps she is a robot. Does this qualify
as a Turing test? Matter of factly, she adds: “Sometimes I think it&#x2019;s time I got a lover.”
She takes a puﬀ of her cigarette and winces. “I don&#x2019;t like that word.” She seems to
taste it in her mouth, “I don&#x2019;t want a boyfriend. Just, you know, someone to have sex
with. That would be okay. No commitments. That would keep people oﬀ my
back. It&#x2019;s embarrassing not having a boyfriend. People keep asking. You
know.”
</p><!--l. 16304--><p class="indent" >  He stares at her, trying not to look at her small breasts, and the long skinny legs
inside her jeans. He imagines what her body is like under there. Ribs and bones, but
soft skin. He imagines feeling her shoulder length blond-bleached hair in his ﬁngers.
He imagines what it would be like. . . He feels a pressure in his groin and his breath
grows short, and feels suddenly oﬀ-guard. “Right”, he says, feeling suddenly
uncomfortable.
</p><!--l. 16312--><p class="indent" >  Is she asking him? Or asking him to ask her? He hardly feels as though he has
connected with her and she springs this on him. It seems way too implausible, but
what a prize. Something about her face seems soft and vulnerable. He wants to reach
out to her. He moves to put a hand brieﬂy and comfortingly on her knee but she sees it
coming and stands up, pretending to want something from her kitchen. His heart
sinks, fooled by expectation. When she comes back she sits on a small wooden chair
on the opposite side of the coﬀee table.
</p><!--l. 16321--><p class="indent" >  Dermot feels a sudden panic. The desire to escape. He says, “So I should be going
soon.”
</p><!--l. 16324--><p class="indent" >  “Okay,” she says and gets up immediately, as though this is what she had been
waiting for all along. She starts rummaging through a jacket. “I need to buy
cigarettes.”
</p><!--l. 16328--><p class="indent" >  He gets up, carefully, conscious of the visibility of his desire, and trying to hide it.
If she notices, she doesn&#x2019;t let on.
</p><!--l. 16331--><p class="indent" >  “So, I&#x2019;ll see you around then,” he pleads, embarrassed by his own desperation,
knowing full well that the chances of it are remote. “I&#x2019;ll let you know if I can get hold
of something at work.”
</p><!--l. 16335--><p class="indent" >  At this, she intrigues him by smiling shyly, as though ﬂattered. “Really?”

</p><!--l. 16338--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah. . .I&#x2019;d like that.”
</p><!--l. 16340--><p class="indent" >  “That would be nice.”
</p><!--l. 16342--><p class="indent" >  She grabs an old-style payment card that was lying on the table and a key,
presumably to the door and users him out into the hallway.
</p><!--l. 16345--><p class="indent" >  “We can go this way,” she says, taking the opposite direction to the way he arrived.
“It&#x2019;s quicker.” Down a short staircase to a second door. He pushes it open. “Oh wait, I
forgot something. So I&#x2019;ll maybe see you then.” She smiles brieﬂy and turns to go
back. Suddenly, Dermot is dispatched into the darkness, not knowing exactly what
happened.

</p><!--l. 16358--><p class="indent" >  Jonas has cancelled his meeting and taken a taxi to the police station. Martin is
trailing in toe, hanging onto his hand. He feels ﬂustered and anxious.
</p><!--l. 16362--><p class="indent" >  “Do you have any idea how many calls like this we hear about these days?”
</p><!--l. 16364--><p class="indent" >  “Are you saying they&#x2019;re common?”
</p><!--l. 16366--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m not saying that the threats are not serious, but this is a widespread problem.
It&#x2019;s not yours in particular.”
</p><!--l. 16369--><p class="indent" >  “So you think this is just a crank call?”
</p><!--l. 16371--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s hard to say.”
</p><!--l. 16373--><p class="indent" >  “But I was shot at!”
</p><!--l. 16375--><p class="indent" >  The duty oﬃcer is calm and matter-of-fact. “It&#x2019;s not pleasant for you I would think,
but I don&#x2019;t see what we can do. Still, I think it&#x2019;s best to err on the side of
caution.”
</p><!--l. 16379--><p class="indent" >  Jonas snorts. “Right. Of course, but is there nothing you can do about it? Can&#x2019;t you
ﬁnd out who it&#x2019;s from?”
</p><!--l. 16383--><p class="indent" >  “I doubt it. I can&#x2019;t see anything in the call logs. The call is registered from an
anonymous Internet location, not from a registered mobile ID. That means we can&#x2019;t
ﬁnd out who really sent it.”
</p><!--l. 16387--><p class="indent" >  “Why is that even possible?” Jonas exclaims in exasperation.
</p><!--l. 16389--><p class="indent" >  The oﬃcer on duty wrinkles his brow. “Good question. Freedom of the Internet.
They don&#x2019;t think about the police when they make these contraptions.”
</p><!--l. 16393--><p class="indent" >  Jonas is looking for advice. “So what now? What should I do? I have to ﬁgure out
what to tell his mother.”
</p><!--l. 16396--><p class="indent" >  “Best advice I can give is to watch your back. We&#x2019;ll make a note of your ID and set
up a panic button on your mobile.” He works at his console behind the clear barrier,
manipulating something. “That way the net will monitor you and you have a short-cut
to assistance.”
</p><!--l. 16401--><p class="indent" >  Jonas stares at nothing through a furrowed brow. Why, of all days, does this have to
happen now?

</p><!--l. 16404--><p class="indent" >  The oﬃcer points a sort of wand at him. “There, you should see a police icon on
your display. It will remain there for a week. After that time you must either renew it
by checking in with us, or let it go.”
</p><!--l. 16409--><p class="indent" >  Jonas nods, stroking the hair on Martin&#x2019;s sleepy head. This has been an exhausting
morning for both of them. Martin has barely said a word all morning.
</p><!--l. 16413--><p class="indent" >  “Let us know if there are any further developments. Apart from that, we just have to
wait and see.”
</p><!--l. 16416--><p class="indent" >  Resignation sinks in; he turns to leave but stops short of the exit. He goes
back.
</p><!--l. 16419--><p class="indent" >  “Can&#x2019;t you tell me something about the group?”
</p><!--l. 16421--><p class="indent" >  The oﬃcer is already doing something else, but replies cheerfully as he types away.
“Most likely the Russian mob, but it&#x2019;s hard to say.”
</p><!--l. 16425--><p class="indent" >  What?! “The mob? Why would they be interested in me?”
</p><!--l. 16428--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t be surprised. They have a hand in most things. Wherever they see an
opportunity to gain power or inﬂuence. Used to be sex and drugs, but other things
have grown in importance.”
</p><!--l. 16432--><p class="indent" >  Nausea pervades Jonas&#x2019; mid-regions. He cannot remember having been scared
before. Not like this. Anxiety, he is no stranger to, but fear? Is it real? Isn&#x2019;t that the
point of fear? You don&#x2019;t know if the threat is real?
</p><!--l. 16436--><p class="indent" >  “Look, go though that exit over there and I&#x2019;ll get you a lift. Go somewhere indoors
and lay low for a while.”
</p><!--l. 16439--><p class="indent" >  Jonas leaves the police station with his new mobile identity. The old ID will be
located at the police station and calls will be relayed to him. It will take them some
time for anyone to track him down again by mobile, at least, and if they try the police
will know. Now he just has to watch his back. As long as he has Martin with him, he
is an easy target.
</p><!--l. 16446--><p class="indent" >  They promised to keep an eye out for Sara too. Jonas has already done his best to
keep her safe and warn her of the call. Now he has other things to take care
of.
</p><!--l. 16450--><p class="indent" >  He pulls up his contacts and dials Kaja.
</p><!--l. 16452--><p class="indent" >  No answer.
</p><!--l. 16455--><p class="indent" >  So he redials. Joe. Joe might help.
</p><!--l. 16457--><p class="indent" >  “Joe? It&#x2019;s Jonas here.”
</p><!--l. 16459--><p class="indent" >  “Good to hear from you again so soon, Jonas.”
</p><!--l. 16461--><p class="indent" >  “Do you have a minute?”
</p><!--l. 16463--><p class="indent" >  “For you, you dog? Never,” he quips.
</p><!--l. 16465--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ll take that as a yes. Something kind of serious has come up for me. I was
wondering if I could ask you a favour.”
</p><!--l. 16468--><p class="indent" >  “Serious? Of course.”
</p><!--l. 16470--><p class="indent" >  “Could you come down to my oﬃce and look after Martin for me for an hour or
two? I&#x2019;ll ﬁll you in on the details when you get here.”
</p><!--l. 16473--><p class="indent" >  “Me?”
</p><!--l. 16475--><p class="indent" >  “I need someone I can trust. Short notice.”

</p><!--l. 16477--><p class="indent" >  “You sound . . . stressed out. Is everything okay?”
</p><!--l. 16479--><p class="indent" >  “Not really. Do you have time? I know I&#x2019;m asking a lot.”
</p><!--l. 16481--><p class="indent" >  “Let me get back to you in a few minutes.”
</p><!--l. 16483--><p class="indent" >  “Thanks.”

<!--l. 16489--><p class="indent" >  Catching a lift with a commando patrol is an excellent adventure for a child of
Martin&#x2019;s age. They depart the police complex, in a patrol car with darkened
windows, and head towards the reality that awaits him at the Research Council
oﬃces. The ride lends him a moment to himself, to consider what he will
say to Kaja when he mans himself up to the task. She is predisposed to go
ballistic with far less provocation. The lack of a good answer leaves his head
spinning.
</p><!--l. 16497--><p class="indent" >  Riding through traﬃc is slow. There are few routes for cars in the city these days.
The command car makes a few short cuts through pedestrian streets. The town is busy
now. That feels safe, he thinks. Safety in numbers.
</p><!--l. 16502--><p class="indent" >  As they arrive at the main street, a gang of youths is parading in ﬂock,
ﬂaunting football colours. It is an ugly sight, Jonas thinks, the revival of the pack
instinct—opportunistic mayhem and animal aﬀectations. At least they are spared the
marching bands that appear around the May celebrations, for the time being, and the
teenage school leavers with their big red busses blasting music to the four corners,
discovering sex and alcohol for the ﬁrst time. At least it&#x2019;s only thoughtless barbarism.
Fuck.
</p><!--l. 16511--><p class="indent" >  Perhaps the rain will wash them away. In these winter months, you have to be fairly
hard core to march down a street or hang out on a corner, simply to show your
allegiance or deﬁance, or whatever the hell it is they are trying to show. Is there any
connection between these and the hooligans Sara mentioned?
</p><!--l. 16517--><p class="indent" >  Sara. How is she doing?
</p><!--l. 16520--><p class="indent" >  They glide through the town, stopping at lights and pausing at the plethora of new
roundabouts. It seems detached from the world in patrol car, as though they are really
watching society on TV, or in a VR game. How do the police relate to the people
when they are so isolated? Silly question: how does anyone relate to one other, when
they are all in a world of their own?
</p><!--l. 16527--><p class="indent" >  They pass fake statues in the square by the theatre. Some sage soul has deemed it
important to make copies of the Vigeland monument statues as part of an exhibition
which has yet to be cleared up: a cheap copy of a petriﬁcation of human
spirit: little ﬁgures all reaching up in hope, or perhaps exasperation, to the
heavens. If only such perfection of form were really a symbol of the human
condition.

</p><!--l. 16535--><p class="indent" >  In truth we are just ﬁghting oﬀ the weeds in an overgrown, blighted vegetable
patch, he thinks.
</p>
<div class="center"

<!--l. 16539--><p class="noindent" >
</p><!--l. 16540--><p class="noindent" >*</p></div>
<!--l. 16543--><p class="indent" >  The car deposits them at the rotating door of the Research council. Some light snow
has fallen and the steps are slippery. Jonas carries Martin under his arm, up the steps
and through the rotating portal.
</p><!--l. 16547--><p class="indent" >  “Mr. Lindgren, they are waiting for you in meeting room four.”
</p><!--l. 16549--><p class="indent" >  Fabulous.
</p><!--l. 16551--><p class="indent" >  “All right, I&#x2019;ll be there as soon as I can.”
</p><!--l. 16553--><p class="indent" >  He sets Martin down and pulls him gently to the elevator. He needs to
install Martin in his oﬃce before he can join any meetings, or catch up on his
messages.
</p><!--l. 16557--><p class="indent" >  He sees on his wristband that Joe has called back and apologized for not being able
to come. Some kid with a crisis of his own to deal with. Jonas is sympathetic. That is
going to make the day harder.
</p><!--l. 16561--><p class="indent" >  Ejected from the elevator, they meander their way along the hallway. It requires
some eﬀort to have the patience for a child under the circumstances. He pushes into
his oﬃce and ﬁnds it a mess. Martin follows him in and runs to the window to look
out. A dark thought chills him.
</p><!--l. 16566--><p class="indent" >  “Martin! I think we&#x2019;d better keep away from the window today.”
</p><!--l. 16568--><p class="indent" >  The boy turns to look at him, comprehending the message, but he does not move.
Jonas pulls him away and takes out some colouring books, some crayons and a
few mind-games to play with. He makes a space for him in the corner of the
room, where he has a small coﬀee table. Martin likes to look in the books
that Jonas keeps here – especially the ones with mathematical formulae in
them. Jonas ﬁnds an old book that he can leaf through and places it within
reach.
</p><!--l. 16576--><p class="indent" >  Before he can orient himself, two colleagues knock and push into his oﬃce,
circumspectly, glancing only momentarily at Martin. They look upset. Mari Roness
and Atle Alnes: their faces are a study in anxiety.
</p><!--l. 16580--><p class="indent" >  “Jonas, have you heard about the meeting?” Roness says, without waiting for an
invitation.
</p><!--l. 16583--><p class="indent" >  Jonas shakes his head. “Something important came up.”
</p><!--l. 16585--><p class="indent" >  “Well, you had better know then.”
</p><!--l. 16587--><p class="indent" >  “Know what?”
</p><!--l. 16589--><p class="indent" >  “Things have been happening this morning while you were away.”
</p><!--l. 16591--><p class="indent" >  “What things?”
</p><!--l. 16593--><p class="indent" >  “They revoked next year&#x2019;s proposal from the council board.”

</p><!--l. 16595--><p class="indent" >  “Who did?”
</p><!--l. 16597--><p class="indent" >  “The ministry,” Alnes adds.
</p><!--l. 16599--><p class="indent" >  “What?”
</p><!--l. 16601--><p class="indent" >  There is nodding. They exchange signiﬁcant looks.
</p><!--l. 16603--><p class="indent" >  “The ministry wants to override our plan for the coming year?”
</p><!--l. 16605--><p class="indent" >  “They already have done.”
</p><!--l. 16607--><p class="indent" >  “How can they. . .”
</p><!--l. 16609--><p class="indent" >  “All our plans for the year are now forfeit.”
</p><!--l. 16611--><p class="indent" >  “How did this happen?”
</p><!--l. 16613--><p class="indent" >  “We were outvoted by a single vote on the board.”
</p><!--l. 16615--><p class="indent" >  He struggles to comprehend. “But, weren&#x2019;t we all agreed?”
</p><!--l. 16617--><p class="indent" >  “We were, but I think someone has been spreading rumours behind the scenes. You
know Skagen is a puppet for the ministry.”
</p><!--l. 16620--><p class="indent" >  “Skagen did this?”
</p><!--l. 16622--><p class="indent" >  “The little creep.”
</p><!--l. 16624--><p class="indent" >  “Great. I turn my back for a moment. . .”
</p><!--l. 16626--><p class="indent" >  “This is bad news, Jonas. They are laughing at us.”
</p><!--l. 16628--><p class="indent" >  “They are not the only ones. The whole of the research community is going to be
laughing at us, and hopping mad.”
</p><!--l. 16631--><p class="indent" >  “We&#x2019;ll take the brunt of it.”
</p><!--l. 16633--><p class="indent" >  “Where&#x2019;s John?”
</p><!--l. 16635--><p class="indent" >  “Who?”
</p><!--l. 16637--><p class="indent" >  “The intern. English guy. He was going to attend for me, in case there were any
questions to be answered.”
</p><!--l. 16640--><p class="indent" >  “But he can&#x2019;t vote for you?”
</p><!--l. 16642--><p class="indent" >  “I realize that.”
</p><!--l. 16644--><p class="indent" >  “I haven&#x2019;t seen him. Maybe he is still in the meeting. I think they are still talking
about other stuﬀ.”
</p><!--l. 16647--><p class="indent" >  “This is outrageous.”
</p><!--l. 16649--><p class="indent" >  “We never stood a chance you know. It was decided high up at the last
minute.”
</p><!--l. 16652--><p class="indent" >  “We have spent months ﬁguring out these allocations. All the work in reviewing the
proposals, all the time spent. . .”
</p><!--l. 16655--><p class="indent" >  “You don&#x2019;t have to convince us.”
</p><!--l. 16657--><p class="indent" >  He feels himself boiling. “What the hell is the point of wasting our time carrying
out this whole rigmarole procedure if they never had any intention of letting us
decide?”
</p><!--l. 16661--><p class="indent" >  “Keeping up the appearance of democracy?”
</p><!--l. 16663--><p class="indent" >  “What democracy?” he stabs.
</p><!--l. 16665--><p class="indent" >  His mobile announces an incoming call from the reception. He juggles with
whether to take the call or ignore it. He has only sent his new mobile ID to a few
key contacts, but this is not quite the time for just anyone to call. He buries
it.

</p><!--l. 16670--><p class="indent" >  “This little pin-prick with a tight collar, from the ministry, came up here and started
telling us that there is a crisis taking place in world opinion.”
</p><!--l. 16673--><p class="indent" >  “What the hell is that supposed to mean?”
</p><!--l. 16675--><p class="indent" >  His combo registers an incoming message. Jonas kills the sound.
</p><!--l. 16677--><p class="indent" >  “It means that we have to divert funds to approved charities to be perceived as a
good Christian nation by the U.S..”
</p><!--l. 16680--><p class="indent" >  “By the U.S.?”
</p><!--l. 16682--><p class="indent" >  “Who else? The U.S. is claiming that they are going to start selecting their
collaborative grants more carefully, so as to only work with so-called decent Christian
countries. It is part of the Moral Campaign Against Terror.”
</p><!--l. 16686--><p class="indent" >  Martin is tugging at his arm, always quiet, but wanting attention.
</p><!--l. 16688--><p class="indent" >  “What is it, tiger?”
</p><!--l. 16690--><p class="indent" >  He whispers in Jonas&#x2019; ear.
</p><!--l. 16692--><p class="indent" >  “Ah, sorry, pal. You just sit tight here, and I&#x2019;ll be back in a little while.” He beckons
the others out of the oﬃce.
</p><!--l. 16695--><p class="indent" >  “Sorry, he doesn&#x2019;t like it when we get agitated. Daddy&#x2019;s supposed to be the calm
one.”
</p><!--l. 16697--><p class="indent" >  They translate their conversation to the hall space: a small group of seats next to a
shelf of journals.
</p><!--l. 16700--><p class="indent" >  “What were we saying? So the ministry is saying what?”
</p><!--l. 16702--><p class="indent" >  “America. Christian countries.”
</p><!--l. 16704--><p class="indent" >  “Right. So, is that us or not us?”
</p><!--l. 16706--><p class="indent" >  “Well, his argument goes roughly like this. The failure of the E.U. to ratify the
Christian State has blackened Europe&#x2019;s name in Congress, so they are turning to the
most Christian countries and bypassing the parliament. Scandinavia has a large
evangelist community. . .so. . .”
</p><!--l. 16712--><p class="indent" >  “Religious means evangelist, pretty much.”
</p><!--l. 16714--><p class="indent" >  “And that means. . .”
</p><!--l. 16716--><p class="indent" >  “That we have to be in America&#x2019;s good books, so we have to make a strong
commitment to support an openly Christian project.”
</p><!--l. 16719--><p class="indent" >  “The famine relief?”
</p><!--l. 16721--><p class="indent" >  “Research is not a religious calling,” Roness says ironically. “You can&#x2019;t sell
knowledge to moralists.”
</p><!--l. 16724--><p class="indent" >  “Meaning what? That we cannot spend money on actual research if we want to be
in their good books? It sounds like an excuse to keep the rest of the world behind
competitively, if you ask me.”
</p><!--l. 16728--><p class="indent" >  “There&#x2019;s probably a hundred ways to interpret it. The bottom line is that we are
being steam-rollered by the ministry.”
</p><!--l. 16731--><p class="indent" >  “And they just spring this on us today?”
</p><!--l. 16733--><p class="indent" >  “Just today.”
</p><!--l. 16735--><p class="indent" >  Jonas&#x2019; mobile announces another call. It is from Kaja.
</p><!--l. 16737--><p class="indent" >  “Damn.” He throws the others a glance. “I have to take this, can I talk to you
later?”

</p><!--l. 16740--><p class="indent" >  He rises and goes back into his oﬃce. A incoming memo has arrived, in the folder,
right next to his panic button. Sara has been asking for help again, but he simply
doesn&#x2019;t have time to talk to her directly, or ﬁgure out what is going on with the
embassy.
</p><!--l. 16745--><p class="indent" >  He accepts the call. “Kaja?”
</p><!--l. 16747--><p class="indent" >  “Yes? I saw that you called.”
</p><!--l. 16749--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ve been trying to call you for hours.”
</p><!--l. 16751--><p class="indent" >  “I was busy. You know that I am at work.”
</p><!--l. 16753--><p class="indent" >  “I know, but something has come up.”
</p><!--l. 16755--><p class="indent" >  He hears her voice quality change, as an edge of hostility enters. “And you
are going to tell me that you have something more important to do than my
work?”
</p><!--l. 16758--><p class="indent" >  “No, that isn&#x2019;t what. . .”
</p><!--l. 16760--><p class="indent" >  “What did the doctor say?”
</p><!--l. 16762--><p class="indent" >  “The doctor?”
</p><!--l. 16764--><p class="indent" >  “That doctor? That you were supposed to. . .”
</p><!--l. 16766--><p class="indent" >  “Ah.”
</p><!--l. 16768--><p class="indent" >  “Jonas! Didn&#x2019;t you take him to the doctor? You were supposed to take your son to
the doctor!”
</p><!--l. 16770--><p class="indent" >  Shit. “Sorry, Kaja. Something happened and it wasn&#x2019;t possible.”
</p><!--l. 16772--><p class="indent" >  “My god, Jonas. What is wrong with you?”
</p><!--l. 16774--><p class="indent" >  “I know it . . .”
</p><!--l. 16776--><p class="indent" >  “Can&#x2019;t I ask you to do even a simple thing?”
</p><!--l. 16778--><p class="indent" >  “Something more important came up. We need to talk about it.”
</p><!--l. 16780--><p class="indent" >  “What could possibly be more important than your son?”

could look after him today?”
</p><!--l. 16785--><p class="indent" >  “My mother?”
</p><!--l. 16787--><p class="indent" >  “We should get him out of the town.”
</p><!--l. 16789--><p class="indent" >  “What are you talking about, Jonas?”

</p><!--l. 16806--><p class="indent" >  “I am tired of listening to your whining. This time you are just going to have to
look after him. I have work, and I have plans. . .”
</p><!--l. 16809--><p class="indent" >  “What plans? Look, Kaja, this is important.” So she is going out? With
whom?

</p><!--l. 16811--><p class="indent" >  “I am important, Jonas. I am a human being. You might not want to have a life, but
I certainly do.”
</p><!--l. 16814--><p class="indent" >  “Wait, you didn&#x2019;t say anything about going out tonight.”
</p><!--l. 16816--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t have to tell you about my plans.”
</p><!--l. 16818--><p class="indent" >  “What about me?”
</p><!--l. 16820--><p class="indent" >  “What about you? We are broken up, don&#x2019;t you remember?”
</p><!--l. 16822--><p class="indent" >  How could I forget. “So, you never even. . .”
</p><!--l. 16824--><p class="indent" >  “What?”
</p><!--l. 16826--><p class="indent" >  ”All this was to get me to baby-sit Martin because you are going out? He isn&#x2019;t
really sick at all, right? This was your idea.” He winces, seeing Martin pretending not
to listen in the corner of the room.
</p><!--l. 16830--><p class="indent" >  “I ask you to do a simple thing. . .”
</p><!--l. 16832--><p class="indent" >  “So who are you seeing? No, don&#x2019;t tell me I don&#x2019;t want to know.”
</p><!--l. 16834--><p class="indent" >  “I wouldn&#x2019;t tell you even if you asked.”
</p><!--l. 16836--><p class="indent" >  He attempts to wrench himself back from pyrotechnics. “Fine. Look, Kaja,
something odd happened today that is important.”
</p><!--l. 16839--><p class="indent" >  “Jonas, how many times do I have to say it. It is your turn. I don&#x2019;t care what you
have on your plate today. I am also important and you are going to be a father to your
child.”
</p><!--l. 16843--><p class="indent" >  “Kaja, please listen.”
</p><!--l. 16845--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t you dare make me come over there and get him, Jonas!” She exudes
something between a growl and a scream and terminates the call.
</p><!--l. 16848--><p class="indent" >  Silence. Embarrassment in front of his child.
</p><!--l. 16850--><p class="indent" >  He reels momentarily at her rebuttal, though he is well used to these by now. With a
little transcendental meditation and some deep breaths, he will be back in play.
Breathe deeply. Breathe.
</p><!--l. 16854--><p class="indent" >  What bothers him the most is that, in the whole of their interaction, he did not
manage to communicate a single piece of important information.

<!--l. 16865--><p class="indent" >  Jonas has a poem that helps him to calm down. Something he learned as a child. It
helps him to recite it, to focus on the words.
     Astronomy is 1derful<br />
     And interesting 2<br />
     The ear3volves around the sun<br />
     And makes a year 4 you<br />
     The moon aﬀects the sur5 heard<br />

     By law of phy6 great<br />
     It&#x2019;s 7 when the stars so bright<br />
     Do nightly scintill8<br />
     If watchful providence be9<br />
     With good intentions fraught<br />
     Should not keep up her watch divine<br />
     We soon should come to 0 (nought).<br />
</p><!--l. 16883--><p class="indent" >  The verse is old. He believes it comes from the early part of the twentieth century. It
reminds him of a more innocent age: an age in which topics like knowledge and
astronomy were viewed diﬀerently: as fanciful escapist concepts, for a world that was
interested in playing with ideas—a world that respected science and mathematics.
There are no politics in the verse. It is pure and clean. It is about cleverness and
goodness, not hidden agendas or deception.
</p><!--l. 16891--><p class="indent" >  How did science reach this sorry state of aﬀairs? When did politics become more
important than creativity? He looks at Martin and wonders whether his innocent
interest in books that he cannot understand is fundamentally misplaced, in this age.
That kind of innocence belongs to a less cynical time.
</p><!--l. 16897--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">So what are we going to do, you and I?</span>
</p><!--l. 16900--><p class="indent" >  Jonas looks at his mobile, wondering who he can call, or what it can do for him to
get him out of this mess. How much we rely on this thing. How useless it seems now.
He ought to take Martin out of town. It was a stupid idea to come here, the most
obvious place to ﬁnd him. He starts to pack some things. They can stay at a
hotel
</p><!--l. 16906--><p class="indent" >  It is at times like this he wishes they still had their baby-sitter. When Martin was
younger, and he and Kaja were still a couple, they would try to get out, to keep the
romance alive. They had a sitter then. He liked their baby-sitter; she was a round,
red-faced woman, in the process of shedding middle age. She was full of life and
good humour. She kept them in good spirits. She lived out of the centre of
town.
</p><!--l. 16913--><p class="indent" >  Every Thursday evening they would pick up Martin from the sitter and plan to go
out for dinner to a restaurant where he could play in a special adventure pen. They
always asked the sitter if she would join them.
</p><!--l. 16918--><p class="indent" >  “Lill—you can join us, if you like,” he would say, but she would always
decline.
</p><!--l. 16921--><p class="indent" >  He remembers her cheerful ruddiness.“No—you kids go ahead. I have these
menopausal ﬂushes, I&#x2019;m afraid, loves. There&#x2019;s no way I can be out. Sweat like a pig.
Drives me crazy. Oﬀ you go now!”
</p><!--l. 16925--><p class="indent" >  She was hindered by hormones, simply chemicals without malice — surely a better
fate to be than to be hindered by a brain-dead bureaucracy that knows full well what it
is doing. He would pay her double now, if she were still sitting. Then he could put
Martin somewhere safe and try to sort things out here. He cannot just run away from
his responsibilities.

</p><!--l. 16933--><p class="indent" >  He looks through his messages. Little advertisement billboards shift and change on
the display. There are some notes about Sara&#x2019;s funding, some internal memos and an
anonymous message, routed from his old ID. ‘<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">We will give you one week to provide us</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">with the information we need. We have located the girl. We are watching</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">you.</span>&#x2019;
</p><!--l. 16939--><p class="indent" >  He feels a chill, in spite of the reassurances by the police..
</p><!--l. 16941--><p class="indent" >  And Kaja will be dating someone, probably surrendering her beauty to someone he
does not even know. He feels a surge of anger or panic, something indeﬁnable. He
remembers the noise she made before cutting their call; he wants to repeat
it.
</p><!--l. 16946--><p class="indent" >  Who can imagine how Martin must be feeling right now, to be abandoned like this
by his mother. She is a perfect product of the modern age: self-centred and incapable
of doing wrong. She has tricked him into being her baby-sitter, and now even
unwittingly exposed him to danger.
</p><!--l. 16951--><p class="indent" >  He considers ripping the mobile out of his clothes. Suddenly this part of him
seems like a tumour – a malignancy that has grafted itself onto his body and
opened him to a slow degenerative disease. The temptation is strong, but
who can do without one? Soon, even Martin will have to have one of his
own.
</p><!--l. 16957--><p class="indent" >  He watches his child, wanting to go over and hug him, but not wanting to interrupt
his play; he seems happy, in a world of his own. He is reading about ancient Egypt
and drawing, absorbed in the colour images. He does not need computer animated
antics to satisfy any need for stimulation. He does not seem concerned with
whatever he perceives is going on around him today. So trusting. Jonas envies
him that level of detachment. What he would give to go back to that time of
innocence, that feeling of safety and wonder. Things change though, don&#x2019;t
they?
</p><!--l. 16968--><p class="indent" >  The chapter title in his book triggers a memory of his own growing up: Tut Ankh
Amon. The name that kept changing. As a child it was just Tooten Karmen – or even
Rootin Tootin Karmen. Then suddenly, at some indeﬁnable moment, the
word Anhk became apparent to him, in the blur of sounds. He learned about
the Ankh symbol. He learned its meaning of freedom. Then he learned the
word Amon, a king. And then there were three words: the transformation
was complete. He would never hear the sounds with the same ignorance and
innocence again. How does one express what that change meant? It was a
time of ambivalence: a feeling of enrichment, combined with a feeling of
loss.
</p><!--l. 16979--><p class="indent" >  That process of learning is going away now, he realizes. Society is no longer
interested in those details. As long as you can fake it, you&#x2019;re accepted.
</p><!--l. 16983--><p class="indent" >  He looks at the clock on his wall panel. It is almost 15:30. If they are going to get
out of the city, he should leave now.
</p><!--l. 16986--><p class="indent" >  The door pushes open again. “Jonas, we need to talk.”
</p><!--l. 16989--><p class="indent" >  Roness enters again.

</p><!--l. 16991--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m a bit short on time right now.”
</p><!--l. 16993--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s important. They want to put a stop to all expenditure on current projects. That
means that hundreds of stipends and fellowships will be frozen.”
</p><!--l. 16996--><p class="indent" >  “Can anything else go wrong today?”
</p><!--l. 16998--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t jinx it.”
</p><!--l. 17000--><p class="indent" >  “But they cannot just stop those monies, surely. Isn&#x2019;t it illegal?”
</p><!--l. 17002--><p class="indent" >  “They have made the terms so complicated that no one is sure, to be honest. We
will have to consult lawyers.”
</p><!--l. 17005--><p class="indent" >  “Can we move some funds to safety for emergencies?”
</p><!--l. 17007--><p class="indent" >  She raises an eyebrow.
</p><!--l. 17009--><p class="indent" >  “All right, stupid question.”
</p><!--l. 17013--><p class="indent" >  “I just heard that I will have to re-apply for funds that I have already received.”
</p><!--l. 17016--><p class="indent" >  “Re-apply?”
</p><!--l. 17018--><p class="indent" >  “The ministry has overridden the decision of the funding committee. They have
enforced a political agenda, apparently based on this business of Christian
politics.”
</p><!--l. 17022--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s terrible.”
</p><!--l. 17024--><p class="indent" >  “I can think of another word.”
</p><!--l. 17026--><p class="indent" >  “What can we do?”
</p><!--l. 17028--><p class="indent" >  “I would suggest moving to another country, but they are all the same now. The
system has become corrupt.”
</p><!--l. 17031--><p class="indent" >  “Everywhere.”
</p><!--l. 17033--><p class="indent" >  “We have to ﬁght them at their own game.”
</p><!--l. 17035--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t know. What are we going to do, bribe people in the ministry?”
</p><!--l. 17037--><p class="indent" >  “Why not. When you work in a system this complex, low level corruption becomes
a survival tool – an act of rebellion against the bureaucracy.”
</p><!--l. 17041--><p class="indent" >  He laughs, uncertain whether to take the idea seriously.
</p><!--l. 17044--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s half of it – something we need to discuss seriously here as a matter of
policy. I don&#x2019;t think we should accept this decision without a ﬁght.”
</p><!--l. 17048--><p class="indent" >  “How can we stop it?”
</p><!--l. 17050--><p class="indent" >  “We could strike? I don&#x2019;t know—there are things we could do.”
</p><!--l. 17052--><p class="indent" >  “Strike?” That is a thought he has not considered before.
</p><!--l. 17054--><p class="indent" >  “Think about it.” She sees that he is collecting his things together. “Are you
leaving?”
</p><!--l. 17057--><p class="indent" >  “Uh, yes. Something important has come up with Martin here. I have to
leave.”
</p><!--l. 17059--><p class="indent" >  “Will you be at the Social Science Seminar tomorrow?”
</p><!--l. 17061--><p class="indent" >  “Is that tomorrow?” He snorts. “Of course it is. That&#x2019;s out of town somewhere, if I
recall. Sundvolden?”
</p><!--l. 17064--><p class="indent" >  “It was moved. Just past Holmenkollen.”
</p><!--l. 17066--><p class="indent" >  “Really? How are you getting there?”
</p><!--l. 17068--><p class="indent" >  “There&#x2019;s a bus or the Tube. Atle might be taking a car.”

</p><!--l. 17070--><p class="indent" >  “Right. Yes. Actually that suits me very well. But I&#x2019;ll have to bring Martin with
me.”
</p><!--l. 17073--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t suppose anyone will mind. Sweet child.” She winks at him, but he is not
looking.
</p><!--l. 17076--><p class="indent" >  “Good, then we can talk some more there.”
</p><!--l. 17078--><p class="indent" >  “What&#x2019;s the other half?”
</p><!--l. 17080--><p class="indent" >  “Excuse me?”
</p><!--l. 17082--><p class="indent" >  “You said that civil disobedience was only half the story.”
</p><!--l. 17084--><p class="indent" >  “Oh. It was on the news. Some high level programmer has been kidnapped in
Slovenia. Some kind of Russian hacker collective has been trying to track him
down.”
</p><!--l. 17088--><p class="indent" >  “Slovenia?”
</p><!--l. 17090--><p class="indent" >  “A lot of programming houses. It was apparently motivated by game-related
conﬂicts spilling over into the real world.”
</p><!--l. 17093--><p class="indent" >  “People have some funny ideas about this game.”
</p><!--l. 17095--><p class="indent" >  “Police channels have issued an alert to American civilians. The American
embassy has shut down after threats of reprisals, in connection with the leaked
story.”
</p><!--l. 17099--><p class="indent" >  “Really? That might explain a few things. Have they known about it a long
time?”
</p><!--l. 17102--><p class="indent" >  “The kidnap is new, but apparently they have been receiving threats every since the
damn broke.”
</p><!--l. 17105--><p class="indent" >  And now we&#x2019;re all damn broke, he thinks. A voice call comes in on his combo.
Internal.
</p><!--l. 17108--><p class="indent" >  “All right – I&#x2019;ll see you tomorrow.”
</p><!--l. 17110--><p class="indent" >  She nods and leaves.
</p><!--l. 17112--><p class="indent" >  He accepts the call. “Hello, Mr. Lindgren.”
</p><!--l. 17115--><p class="indent" >  “Hi.”
</p><!--l. 17117--><p class="indent" >  “We spoke earlier, about the funds for your student. I thought I had better let you
know that the problem is now moot. I&#x2019;m afraid that the funds have now been frozen by
executive order. To gain access to them, you will have to re-apply for coverage under a
new environmental program.”
</p><!--l. 17123--><p class="indent" >  News travels fast. “So I heard.”
</p><!--l. 17125--><p class="indent" >  “Do you want me to start the procedure?”
</p><!--l. 17127--><p class="indent" >  “I suppose you better had.”
</p><!--l. 17129--><p class="indent" >  “Okay. I&#x2019;ll come back to you with details later.”
</p><!--l. 17131--><p class="indent" >  “Bye.”
</p><!--l. 17133--><p class="indent" >  He sighs. “Martin, come on, pal. We have to leave.”

<!--l. 17140--><p class="indent" >  He ushers Martin into the elevator. They will have to walk to the car rental or get a
taxi to make it to the hotel where the conference will take place. It is the perfect place
to hide out. Kaja can reach him, if she needs to, and she can go to hell if she doesn&#x2019;t
like it.
</p><!--l. 17145--><p class="indent" >  He pushes the button and they descend towards the main entrance. The doors seem
to take forever to close, the controls are sluggish and worn. The glass-metal box falls
down to the main reception.
</p><!--l. 17149--><p class="indent" >  His mobile beeps on the internal channel: a message from reception. “Mr Lindgren.
I have a visitor for you. A foreign gentleman. He is waiting here. Is it all right if I send
him up?”
</p><!--l. 17153--><p class="indent" >  The words arrest time for him as they unfold in his consciousness. Jonas&#x2019; heart
explodes. Panic strikes him. In his mind, he sees a man in a raincoat with a silenced
weapon waiting to catch them in their brief trip in and out of the research council
oﬃces. The man brandishes his weapon openly and scowls at him with a dark
shadow of a beard. His eyes spell danger. He aims the weapon and a woman
screams.
</p><!--l. 17160--><p class="indent" >  Jonas wrenches himself from the vision and hits the button for the next ﬂoor, to stop
the lift from descending, but it is too late; the lift has already passed it and refuses to
obey his will. A part of his mind tells him to reach for his mobile armband.
The interface is active and it displays a panic button to call for help, as a
bright police logo. His muscles tense to perform the act, but before he is
able to muster a response, the carriage clunks to a halt and the doors jerk
open.
</p><!--l. 17170--><p class="indent" >  They are presented with the open area of the reception, bared to its space. It is quiet
and apparently empty.
</p><!--l. 17173--><p class="indent" >  Light races along his line of sight, starting from the receptionist&#x2019;s desk and
impinging on his retina like a meteor shot from the heart of fate. The receptionist sees
him, from the corner of her eye, and starts to turn. Her eyes meet his and he tries to
mouth words that will shape the situation, but it is too late for that. His mind
has ﬂooded with reptilian ﬂight, and although his racing heart has stretched
the moment into an epoch, he is unable to take advantage of the chemical
acceleration.
</p><!--l. 17182--><p class="indent" >  “Ah, there he is,” the receptionist exclaims.
</p><!--l. 17184--><p class="indent" >  Jonas feels a paradox of paralysis overcome him, his legs numbed into inactivity,
his mind wiped out by a bright light. He perceives a tall raincoat turn swiftly from a
shelf of brochures and the ﬁgure&#x2019;s eyes meet his. “Jonas!”
</p><!--l. 17189--><p class="indent" >  Joe.
</p><!--l. 17191--><p class="indent" >  Only now does he breathe deeply, and in gasping breaths; he feels his heart
hammering painfully in his chest, and his body ﬁghts to overcome the ﬂood of
chemicals it has unleashed into his brain.
</p><!--l. 17195--><p class="indent" >  Joe walks towards him. “I managed to get away, and thought I had better
come.” He regards him with concern. “Are you all right, Jonas? You looks
pale.”

</p><!--l. 17198--><p class="indent" >  “Joe.”
</p><!--l. 17200--><p class="indent" >  “Hey Martin, how are you doing? Are you leaving?”
</p><!--l. 17202--><p class="indent" >  “Yes. I don&#x2019;t think we should stay here.” He sees that Joe is dry. “How did you get
here?”
</p><!--l. 17205--><p class="indent" >  “I have my car just up the road.”
</p><!--l. 17207--><p class="indent" >  “Good. Can you give us a lift? I can explain on the way.”

</p><!--l. 17259--><p class="indent" >  Preeta&#x2019;s ﬁrst days with the team have been dull but restful. She could easily become
accustomed to this life of pampering, of tolerance. They seem to show her respect
beyond what is due to her. Perhaps they are fools. Whatever the reason, she is not
ungrateful.
</p><!--l. 17265--><p class="indent" >  They assign her credit for things that she was merely doing as part of her job. She is
no hero. She is no genius. She is a conduit for other&#x2019;s thoughts and ideas.
She is a dumb runaway girl who has never been able to ﬁt in. But it doesn&#x2019;t
matter, because most importantly, she is a survivor. She survives by going with
the ﬂow, wherever it might take her, and then living oﬀ the new land she
discovers.
</p><!--l. 17272--><p class="indent" >  It has always been like that. No reason to stop now. Maybe one day, if she
ever settles somewhere and becomes happy, if she ever feels safe, then she
will discover who she really is—not just who someone else wants her to
be.
</p><!--l. 17277--><p class="indent" >  Will that be here? Who cares. She&#x2019;s still young. There are still places to go and
people to meet. And here? So far, she has felt closest to the woman at the
tram stop. One cannot say that the average person on the street has been
friendly.
</p><!--l. 17283--><p class="indent" >  Yesterday, she ventured out and stepped into the path of two men walking along the
street. She smiled at them, innocently enough, and mumbled “Hello”. The one on the
left glared at her and stopped in his tracks.
</p><!--l. 17288--><p class="indent" >  “Do you know me, lady?”
</p><!--l. 17290--><p class="indent" >  Preeta is shocked and said nothing.
</p><!--l. 17292--><p class="indent" >  “Do you know me?”
</p><!--l. 17294--><p class="indent" >  “No, I don&#x2019;t know you.”
</p><!--l. 17296--><p class="indent" >  “Let me tell you! You don&#x2019;t want to know me, lady! You don&#x2019;t want to know me!
So what&#x2019;s it to you?”
</p><!--l. 17299--><p class="indent" >  As she continued on her way, another face, pock marked and grey, almost like a

corpse was framed in her absent stare. He looked old and young at the same time. She
has seen thin people, but never one that looked so sick.
</p><!--l. 17304--><p class="indent" >  “This is the edge,” he said.
</p><!--l. 17306--><p class="indent" >  “The edge?”
</p><!--l. 17308--><p class="indent" >  “Grensen. The ﬁnal frontier. Give me some money?”
</p><!--l. 17310--><p class="indent" >  She shook her head. Here? In Europe? In India, she might have considered it, in
Malaysia, she would have frowned, but here in the centre of Western perfection it
seems like an obscenity.
</p><!--l. 17314--><p class="indent" >  “Look, I just want a beer okay? What the hell is wrong with you?”
</p><!--l. 17316--><p class="indent" >  “Sorry.”
</p><!--l. 17318--><p class="indent" >  Adjusting to life here will not be easy. This country seems hostile in an entirely
diﬀerent way to the Indian subcontinent.
</p><!--l. 17321--><p class="indent" >  On the other hand, there have been light moments, moments of friendship and
humour. Isn&#x2019;t it funny how you can connect with someone, suddenly, on
some level? Just for an hour or a moment. Then it&#x2019;s gone. Then suddenly it is
someone else. A teleportation from one bubble of reality to another: seeing the
world through someone else&#x2019;s eyes, or a fraction of your own. You share a
moment, or a feeling, perhaps a common sentiment. Whatever. Then it could be
gone, unrecoverable. For that time, you feel close to them; but it doesn&#x2019;t last
long.
</p><!--l. 17331--><p class="indent" >  Is that enough to sustain you through life? Or should she have accepted the
marriage plans that were laid out for her. What panic was it that drove her away from
tradition? Would it have been so terrible?
</p><!--l. 17337--><p class="indent" >  Where is the Padang? The sweet warmth of the air, ﬁlled with fragrances of food?
Where is the sound of traﬃc? This place is a ghost town. Or is there life somewhere
yet to be discovered?

<!--l. 17348--><p class="indent" >  Poking around the game, she works, looking for her former colleagues and
contacts, but they have either disappeared or they are using diﬀerent identities now.
Her own identity has changed, after all. People are cautious on the net these
days.
</p><!--l. 17353--><p class="indent" >  If she should need them, she still has identities and credentials that she saved before
leaving PlasmaScape. They might already have been revoked, but she dare not try
them until absolutely necessary. If she is discovered, then she will have lost a possible
advantage.
</p><!--l. 17358--><p class="indent" >  A message blooms in her garden: <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">We met at Bishop&#x2019;s meeting. Busy? Meet me</span>
<span 
class="ptmb7t-x-x-109">*HERE*</span><span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">? </span>The message contains a link that will carry her into a diﬀerent game, a
diﬀerent place. Message is signed Dermot.

</p><!--l. 17363--><p class="indent" >  She hesitates. Dermot was the creepy one who came in late. Isn&#x2019;t he just down the
hall? Why doesn&#x2019;t he just come and talk to her? Maybe it&#x2019;s a test, or maybe he is shy.
On the other hand, he is the one she has been asked to work with, He is the game
expert. Well, why not? Best to get it over with. She is not getting anywhere with her
search.
</p><!--l. 17369--><p class="indent" >  Preeta clicks on the link and is shunted into game transit mode. A small text
ﬂashes up to tell her that she will soon be entering an isolated multi-player
game cell, that she should defend herself using only weapons that she ﬁnds
there.
</p><!--l. 17374--><p class="indent" >  Her image materializes in a small clearing of a lilac jungle, emergence time just a
couple of seconds, but no one there to see her. Her ocular interface shows a score, or
some kind of health count, a pulse measurement taken from her wrist-band and
collar, and a compass for this world. Although the avatar body is her choice
and design, the clothes it is wearing are not. She is a young girl, with short
blonde hair, and dressed in a one-piece jump-suit. She looks like an action
heroine.
</p><!--l. 17383--><p class="indent" >  Preeta smiles without moving her facial muscles. This place is his idea of a joke
maybe.
</p><!--l. 17386--><p class="indent" >  The glade where she materializes is a fantasy in purple. Giant fronds, erupting from
alien looking trunks, marry together into a wall of thick vegetation. She can see pink
sky above them. A rugged looking stick is lying on the ground in front of her, but she
seems to be otherwise alone. There is an eerie music playing—a horrible cliché.
The whole thing is pretty amateurish—not something a designer would put
together.
</p><!--l. 17394--><p class="indent" >  - Pick up the stick.
</p><!--l. 17396--><p class="indent" >  It could be a weapon. There is a message scraped into the ground before
her:

</p>
  <div class="verbatim" id="verbatim-6">
 <br />THERE'S NO SHAME IN ADMITTING DEFEAT
 <br />
</div>
<!--l. 17403--><p class="nopar" >
</p><!--l. 17405--><p class="indent" >  Give up before starting? What kind of a message is he trying to send? And,
why isn&#x2019;t he here? Is she supposed to ﬁnd him, play hide and seek? Is this
necessary?
</p><!--l. 17409--><p class="indent" >  There is a passage, leading through the jungle behind her, but it descends into some
kind of swamp. The swamp steams with some kind of vapour. She will have to wade
through water to see where it leads. The vegetation around her doesn&#x2019;t seem passable
without implements to help, so swamp would appear to be the only option for
now.
</p><!--l. 17415--><p class="indent" >  So, oﬀ we go then. What dangers or traps lurk in the swamp, we wonder?
</p><!--l. 17418--><p class="indent" >  Preeta has no idea what kind of game this is, or if it even is a real game. Perhaps it
is just a sim that he has bashed together for this occasion? Impossible to know what is
considered good or bad here. The rules are his to decide. Play along for now, at least
until we get bored.
</p><!--l. 17424--><p class="indent" >  She tries out her weapon and tests her movements. Everything seems to work okay.
This is no worse than testing out game modules and debugging. For good measure,
she also checks whether she has debugging access. She doesn&#x2019;t. Worth a try though.
Shouldn&#x2019;t leave any avenues unexplored.
</p><!--l. 17431--><p class="indent" >  Preeta moves towards an opening in the vegetation, and begins to wade through the
river. Her avatar sinks down to its waist. She can see her score dropping slightly as the
body exerts eﬀort. The vegetation snakes up and sideways around her: thick shoots
that end in saucer-like bulbs. The ends of the snake-like protrusions look like
succulents, but that is odd for a jungle.
</p><!--l. 17438--><p class="indent" >  Well, whose jungle? After all, this is a fantasy. The game doesn&#x2019;t have to make
sense. Still, if it were up to her, she would redecorate.
</p><!--l. 17442--><p class="indent" >  Giant cobwebs stretch across the water, hidden partially in the vapours. She comes
to a place where she cannot pass. Using the stick, she clears away the cobwebs,
half-expecting a giant spider to attack. Nothing so corny – but her strength is fading
much faster than normal, with no apparent explanation.
</p><!--l. 17448--><p class="indent" >  She wades for a few minutes to the other side and emerges onto dry land; her body
is covered in leeches, or some such thing. On another day, she might have considered
this to be a challenge.
</p><!--l. 17452--><p class="indent" >  There is some treasure lying on the ground here, by the waterside. Pick it up? That
seems far too obvious.
</p><!--l. 17455--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I could poke it with my stick</span>, she thinks. Probably, she is supposed to.

</p><!--l. 17457--><p class="indent" >  - Poke the treasure with the stick.
</p><!--l. 17459--><p class="indent" >  Out of the jungle there comes a maniacal scream. Drums begin to beat. A ﬁgure in
white robes and a tall hat rushes out of densely packed wood, confronting her with a
stave. It is the Pope.
</p><!--l. 17463--><p class="indent" >  “Who do you think you are? What are you doing here, heathen?”
</p><!--l. 17465--><p class="indent" >  He lunges forward, swiping at her with the crook. She was expecting something
like this, so she is ready. She parries the blow and swipes back at him. He is old and
slow, but he seems to have some kind of power to block her blows. To make it worse,
her own score is falling rapidly. She is being eaten alive and being attacked for her
mortal soul.
</p><!--l. 17471--><p class="indent" >  “Who are you calling heathen, inﬁdel?” she taunts back.
</p><!--l. 17473--><p class="indent" >  They exchange parries several times and the Pope shouts, “In the beginning was the
word. Now words make our new beginnings.”.
</p><!--l. 17476--><p class="indent" >  The pope loses his staﬀ, as she strikes rapid double blows and kicks with her legs at
the same time. If this is a test, she should show Dermot that she is not some push-over
bimbo that he can mess with. “The power is with you, child. But are you ready to
surrender to god?” The Pope back-ﬂips away and gets ready to charge at her. His staﬀ
has regenerated.
</p><!--l. 17483--><p class="indent" >  Preeta jumps and ﬁnds that she can leap up to the branch of one of the trees next to
her. The Pope does not seem to be able to follow her up there, but he prowls like a lion
at the base, calling taunts. “Repent your sins! Confess and be saved. Give to the
church and be redeemed.”
</p><!--l. 17489--><p class="indent" >  Fine. What now? Is she supposed to be going somewhere?
</p><!--l. 17491--><p class="indent" >  She calls out, “Dermot?” Is there a point to this?
</p><!--l. 17493--><p class="indent" >  There is no response.
</p><!--l. 17495--><p class="indent" >  “Dermot?”
</p><!--l. 17497--><p class="indent" >  A nagging part of her begins to wonder: was the person who drew her here
truly Dermot? She did not check the ID carefully. What if <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">they </span>have found
her?
</p><!--l. 17501--><p class="indent" >  Her pulse begins to quicken and she sees that this causes her score to plummet even
faster, In the air before her eyes, ghostly letters slides across her visual ﬁeld and a
voice echoes its message.

</p>
  <div class="verbatim" id="verbatim-7">
 <br /> THE FUTURE IS NEVER WHERE YOU THINK IT IS.

</div>
<!--l. 17509--><p class="nopar" > The tree whispers to her.
</p><!--l. 17512--><p class="indent" >  Shoots from the tree branch start to sway and move. Feelers wrap around her legs
and work their way up her body, covering the leech-like attackers. She is thrust
involuntarily back into a memory of her capture in Kuala Lumpur, and, in her
real body, she feels an unpleasant phantom in her lower regions. Her pulse
sky-rockets.
</p><!--l. 17518--><p class="indent" >  Sharp chill. This is not amusing any more. If this is Dermot&#x2019;s way of saying
welcome, then it leaves something to be desired. If it is an attempt to make her
uncomfortable, then it seems to be working. If, on the other hand, it is the maﬁa
who have located her and are sending her a warning, them she is in deep
trouble.
</p><!--l. 17524--><p class="indent" >  “Stop it!” she calls out. “I give in!”
</p><!--l. 17526--><p class="indent" >  The game stops abruptly, as if nothing abnormal were afoot, and she is lowered to
the ground, next to a male ﬁgure, presumably Dermot. The scenery whitens to show
that it is not active. It simply becomes a chat space.
</p><!--l. 17530--><p class="indent" >  “I thought you might like to see what we do at my day job,” he says
unapologetically.
</p><!--l. 17533--><p class="indent" >  It takes her a moment to respond, but she hides her anxiety and replies simply,
“Well, it&#x2019;s nice, but I&#x2019;m not in the mood.”
</p><!--l. 17536--><p class="indent" >  “Okay.”
</p><!--l. 17538--><p class="indent" >  “Did you want something?”
</p><!--l. 17540--><p class="indent" >  He does not seem to be easily fooled. Something about the pauses in his replies.
One can infer a lot from pauses.
</p><!--l. 17543--><p class="indent" >  His character is a much more handsome man than he is, and much more
solid of character and build. “Thought it was time we met,” he responds,
enigmatically.
</p><!--l. 17548--><p class="indent" >  “You could just try coming to my workstation. I&#x2019;m not dangerous.”
</p><!--l. 17550--><p class="indent" >  “Nope. I&#x2019;m not there. I&#x2019;m working at my real job.”
</p><!--l. 17552--><p class="indent" >  “I see. Well, next time then. Never mind.”
</p><!--l. 17554--><p class="indent" >  He seems more conﬁdent here than he did at the meeting. Obviously this is his way
of being a preferred self.
</p><!--l. 17557--><p class="indent" >  “Bishop told me to work with you. You have knowledge of some of the information
systems that we don&#x2019;t know about?”
</p><!--l. 17560--><p class="indent" >  “I suppose so. He told me you are an expert game programmer.”
</p><!--l. 17562--><p class="indent" >  “I suppose so.”

</p><!--l. 17564--><p class="indent" >  “Then, I suppose you&#x2019;re right.”
</p><!--l. 17566--><p class="indent" >  “I suppose so.”
</p><!--l. 17568--><p class="indent" >  They laugh. “We should get to know each other.”
</p><!--l. 17571--><p class="indent" >  “Okay. So here we are.”
</p><!--l. 17573--><p class="indent" >  “Can we go somewhere else?”
</p><!--l. 17575--><p class="indent" >  His avatar nods. “Tie in and follow me. Hand.”
</p><!--l. 17577--><p class="indent" >  She gives him her hand, and the display dissolves; it fades them into a diﬀerent
place, next to a fountain. It is evening and there are sim-people walking around near to
them. There is something familiar about it.
</p><!--l. 17582--><p class="indent" >  “Where are we?”
</p><!--l. 17584--><p class="indent" >  “Turn around.”
</p><!--l. 17586--><p class="indent" >  She turns around. The twin towers of VKuala Lumpur rise into the night sky,
glittering like Christmas trees, tied together with tinsel.
</p><!--l. 17589--><p class="indent" >  “Welcome home.”
</p><!--l. 17591--><p class="indent" >  She smiles. “The real ones are better, but this is nice.”
</p><!--l. 17593--><p class="indent" >  “Or we could go to VOslo? Has anyone given you the tour?”
</p><!--l. 17595--><p class="indent" >  She shakes her head. “Not yet.”
</p><!--l. 17597--><p class="indent" >  “They will.”
</p><!--l. 17599--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, they have said so.”
</p><!--l. 17601--><p class="indent" >  He nods.
</p><!--l. 17603--><p class="indent" >  “They were talking about taking me out to enjoy the town one night. So far all I
have seen is drug addicts during the day. I heard that there is a night-life. You&#x2019;ll come
along, if we go out?”
</p><!--l. 17607--><p class="indent" >  “Ahh. Well.”
</p><!--l. 17609--><p class="indent" >  “You don&#x2019;t like going out?”
</p><!--l. 17611--><p class="indent" >  “I prefer being in here.”
</p><!--l. 17613--><p class="indent" >  “You should come.”
</p><!--l. 17615--><p class="indent" >  “Maybe.”
</p><!--l. 17617--><p class="indent" >  She nods. “You&#x2019;ll change your mind.”
</p><!--l. 17619--><p class="indent" >  Dermot does not answer. His ﬁgure carefully conceals any link between its
appearance and his feelings. Preeta waits for some change, a sense that he is willing to
let down his barriers, but nothing happens.
</p><!--l. 17623--><p class="indent" >  “All right,” she says. “Let&#x2019;s stay here awhile.”
</p><!--l. 17626--><p class="indent" >  Dermot bows, like some kind of Eastern warrior. “Let me show you some of the
things I do, and then maybe you can do the same.”
</p><!--l. 17629--><p class="indent" >  She okays. “I suppose we have to start somehow.”
</p><!--l. 17631--><p class="indent" >  Dermot smiles: a rare occurrence in the presence of a lady.

</p><!--l. 17645--><p class="indent" >  “I have a personal interest.”

to access them too.”
</p><!--l. 17650--><p class="indent" >  “I know.” She looks at him. “What?”
</p><!--l. 17652--><p class="indent" >  “Nothing.”
</p><!--l. 17654--><p class="indent" >  Manipulating the controls on the interfaces is second nature to her. She can do it,

</p><!--l. 17686--><p class="indent" >  He nods. “Right. Sorry.” His body breaks out into a sweat. “So what are we looking
at?”
</p><!--l. 17690--><p class="indent" >  “There is all kind of activity – a whole new wave of incidents of crime and game

</p><!--l. 17694--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah, Jonathan was talking about there being cases of glitches in the advertising
technologies that have been showing up examples of government manipulation. There
is a whole conspiracy theory about it going down.”
</p><!--l. 17698--><p class="indent" >  Preeta does not reply. At times like this, she almost wishes she wore the hijab. It
can be an eﬀective shield.
</p><!--l. 17701--><p class="indent" >  “So, have you heard any news from anyone back home?”
</p><!--l. 17703--><p class="indent" >  She shakes her head imperceptibly. “I am trying to ﬁnd out something through the

be under a lock-down.”
</p><!--l. 17707--><p class="indent" >  “Well, do they know what has happened to you?”

</p><!--l. 17728--><p class="indent" >  “So, is the software you have been working on any good? Have you found out
anything interesting?”
</p><!--l. 17731--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m not sure. I&#x2019;m still looking. I promised Bishop that I would get started on
testing it out – the software.”
</p><!--l. 17734--><p class="indent" >  “You designed it, right?”
</p><!--l. 17736--><p class="indent" >  “Not exactly. I just applied someone else&#x2019;s ideas to the game.”
</p><!--l. 17738--><p class="indent" >  “Who?”
</p><!--l. 17740--><p class="indent" >  “What?”
</p><!--l. 17742--><p class="indent" >  “Whose ideas?”
</p><!--l. 17744--><p class="indent" >  She glances at him, while still trying to ignore him with her face buried in the
screen. “I can&#x2019;t say.”
</p><!--l. 17747--><p class="indent" >  He looks dissatisﬁed with the answer, but seems to accept it.
</p><!--l. 17749--><p class="indent" >  “So what are you searching for?”
</p><!--l. 17751--><p class="indent" >  “You already asked me that.”
</p><!--l. 17753--><p class="indent" >  “I mean where?”
</p><!--l. 17755--><p class="indent" >  She suppresses a sigh. “Police reports, records. I was trying to get to Interpol, but I
don&#x2019;t know how to get in yet, so I&#x2019;m looking through Europol.”
</p><!--l. 17758--><p class="indent" >  “Find anything useful?”
</p><!--l. 17760--><p class="indent" >  “Not really.”
</p><!--l. 17762--><p class="indent" >  “Look at this though.” She ﬂicks through the list. “A report here, from yesterday
about a similar story, here in Oslo. Someone being threatened for knowledge about
game strategies.”
</p><!--l. 17766--><p class="indent" >  “Well I&#x2019;ve heard of people auctioning game-skills for money, but that&#x2019;s taking it a
bit far.”
</p><!--l. 17769--><p class="indent" >  “It is reported as a realistic threat.”
</p><!--l. 17771--><p class="indent" >  “Coincidence?”
</p><!--l. 17773--><p class="indent" >  “Or someone looking for me?”
</p><!--l. 17775--><p class="indent" >  He shrugs. “No need to be paranoid now. You&#x2019;re safe enough here.”
</p><!--l. 17777--><p class="indent" >  “Easy for you to say.”
</p><!--l. 17779--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah.”
</p><!--l. 17781--><p class="indent" >  “There&#x2019;s more. Maybe just a coincidence.”
</p><!--l. 17783--><p class="indent" >  “More? What?”
</p><!--l. 17785--><p class="indent" >  “Look at this.”

</p><!--l. 17787--><p class="indent" >  Ivar looks at the screen, then to her, then back at the screen and back at her again.
His expressions says: what exactly am I looking at?
</p><!--l. 17790--><p class="indent" >  “Perhaps Jonathan should see this.”
</p><!--l. 17792--><p class="indent" >  He shakes his head profusely. “That&#x2019;s a project in itself.”
</p><!--l. 17794--><p class="indent" >  “What?”
</p><!--l. 17796--><p class="indent" >  “Let&#x2019;s keep it between us.”
</p><!--l. 17798--><p class="indent" >  “Because he is diﬃcult to talk to?”
</p><!--l. 17800--><p class="indent" >  “No, he has no trouble starting a conversation. He just doesn&#x2019;t know how to end
one.”
</p><!--l. 17803--><p class="indent" >  “Ah.” Shyness comes in many forms. “But we should talk to someone?”
</p><!--l. 17806--><p class="indent" >  “But we don&#x2019;t know anything yet.”
</p><!--l. 17808--><p class="indent" >  “Well, nothing exact. What about suspicion?”
</p><!--l. 17810--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s going to sell anyone.”
</p><!--l. 17812--><p class="indent" >  She sighs. “I&#x2019;m not getting anywhere. I should be, but this is the closest thing I&#x2019;ve
found to .. something.”
</p><!--l. 17815--><p class="indent" >  “Too bad.”
</p><!--l. 17817--><p class="indent" >  “But don&#x2019;t you think it&#x2019;s a bit strange?”
</p><!--l. 17819--><p class="indent" >  He shrugs. “Why?”
</p><!--l. 17821--><p class="indent" >  A sigh can also sound silently on the inside. “My instinct tells me that this is
important.”
</p><!--l. 17824--><p class="indent" >  “I wouldn&#x2019;t spend too much time on it, if I were you. Stuﬀ like this comes in a
lot.”
</p><!--l. 17827--><p class="indent" >  She shakes her head. No time to lose heart. She wants to do something.
There needs to be some action. Too much running away, not enough standing
ground.
</p><!--l. 17831--><p class="indent" >  Memory kicks in. The methods. The ﬁve weaknesses. She needs to change the
balance of power. She unties her hair from its pony tail and lets it fall across her
shoulders. She rubs her neck, lifting her arm to puﬀ up her breasts. This usually has an
eﬀect on men. She is not certain whether she is really pretty, but it usually seems to
work.
</p><!--l. 17837--><p class="indent" >  “I would feel a lot better knowing that I had made a contribution here. I feel so
useless.”
</p><!--l. 17840--><p class="indent" >  Ivar notices and seems uncertain whether to be uncomfortable.
</p><!--l. 17842--><p class="indent" >  “No, you&#x2019;re not useless. Don&#x2019;t say that.”
</p><!--l. 17844--><p class="indent" >  “Then why not try to do something?”
</p><!--l. 17846--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah,” he says. “Yeah. Better to be safe than sorry.”
</p><!--l. 17848--><p class="indent" >  She looks directly into his eyes. People don&#x2019;t do that often here. It is too intimate. It
mesmerises. It turns the tables and assumes control.
</p><!--l. 17851--><p class="indent" >  “Let&#x2019;s ask Jonathan. He is police and he will understand. He can do something.”
</p><!--l. 17854--><p class="indent" >  Ivar nods, but remains dumb.
</p><!--l. 17856--><p class="indent" >  She waves across the room. Jonathan strolls over, yawning. “What is it?”
</p><!--l. 17859--><p class="indent" >  Ivar re-animates. “Preeta found something interesting with the new software.”
</p><!--l. 17862--><p class="indent" >  “Really?”

</p><!--l. 17864--><p class="indent" >  She shrugs. “I&#x2019;m not sure. It&#x2019;s hard to say.”
</p><!--l. 17866--><p class="indent" >  “So what is it?”
</p><!--l. 17868--><p class="indent" >  “I was digging into stuﬀ, following some leads.”
</p><!--l. 17870--><p class="indent" >  “Why?”
</p><!--l. 17872--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I have to learn this system somehow, don&#x2019;t I? If I&#x2019;m going to help you catch
criminals.”
</p><!--l. 17875--><p class="indent" >  “Okay.”
</p><!--l. 17877--><p class="indent" >  “I found that you have a honeypot.”
</p><!--l. 17879--><p class="indent" >  He nods. “So?”
</p><!--l. 17881--><p class="indent" >  “Well. It&#x2019;s hard to explain all the connections that . . .”
</p><!--l. 17883--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s why we use the software right?”
</p><!--l. 17885--><p class="indent" >  She smiles. “Right.”
</p><!--l. 17887--><p class="indent" >  Jonathan urges her on.
</p><!--l. 17889--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I was correlating stuﬀ with the new software, just trying it out, and I found
the name of a girl. A student. She is working on a form of robotic programming. Well,
that&#x2019;s not important, well not yet, maybe. Look.”
</p><!--l. 17893--><p class="indent" >  She demonstrates the visualization on the screen in front of her, showing various
interlocking threads, passing through a landscape of colour. “The colours represent
the signiﬁcance of correlations. Hot and cold, you know.”
</p><!--l. 17897--><p class="indent" >  Jonathan appears interested. The graphics are impressive if nothing else.
</p><!--l. 17899--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t really understand this but it looks cool.”
</p><!--l. 17901--><p class="indent" >  “Anyway. Here is the girl. It turns out that she has been spending time in your
honeypot, doing some interesting things. And she is related, in the model, to someone
in the city who was threatened by a mystery caller, assumed Russian maﬁa. They are
both correlated to gaming models that include control of autonomous agents using
open media signals.”
</p><!--l. 17907--><p class="indent" >  “Are you following this?”
</p><!--l. 17909--><p class="indent" >  “This girl they are trying to ﬁnd is one of the people in your honeypot logs, on the
tracker.”
</p><!--l. 17912--><p class="indent" >  “And something about a threat. . .”
</p><!--l. 17914--><p class="indent" >  “A College professor. He was threatened by a Russian sounding voice who asked
about game related knowledge. That correlates with my attack, although it was
probably just a misunderstanding.”
</p><!--l. 17918--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah?” Absorbing the signiﬁcance of the information.
</p><!--l. 17921--><p class="indent" >  “It turns out that she walked into one of the police honeypots and she has been
using the environments to simulate behavioural stuﬀ. It&#x2019;s actually very clever. She has
probably been driving them crazy.”
</p><!--l. 17926--><p class="indent" >  Jonathan looks fatigued, uninterested. “Once more?”
</p><!--l. 17928--><p class="indent" >  “According to the system, she has been correlated with several activities, She
came up on mountain rescue violations, maﬁa threats, an American complaint
about attempting to sabotage an experiment, and a police report somewhere
recently.”
</p><!--l. 17933--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s quite a list.”

</p><!--l. 17935--><p class="indent" >  “It doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean anything, but it gives her a high ranking. Strictly
speaking, correlations are not proof of anything important.”
</p><!--l. 17938--><p class="indent" >  “I suppose not. But I was looking at what she does.”
</p><!--l. 17940--><p class="indent" >  “What does she do?”
</p><!--l. 17942--><p class="indent" >  “She a student. She works on making small robot agents collaborate in
groups.”
</p><!--l. 17944--><p class="indent" >  “So?”
</p><!--l. 17946--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t you see? That is what people are trying to do in the game. By creating an
environment in which people are brought together, without real guidance, but just a
few hints and principles to make them act. ”
</p><!--l. 17951--><p class="indent" >  “Please tell me this is going somewhere.”
</p><!--l. 17953--><p class="indent" >  “What is impressive is that she also knows how to disrupt that cooperation. She has
been doing in the honeypots.”
</p><!--l. 17956--><p class="indent" >  “How can you know that?”
</p><!--l. 17958--><p class="indent" >  “Software.”
</p><!--l. 17960--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah? It really works?”
</p><!--l. 17962--><p class="indent" >  She makes a noise of exasperation. “I don&#x2019;t know if it works. I&#x2019;m just telling you
what it says.”
</p><!--l. 17965--><p class="indent" >  Ivar nods. “So you&#x2019;re saying that she could tell us how to break up this Christian
propaganda campaign that Bishop is so worries about.”
</p><!--l. 17969--><p class="indent" >  “I was thinking that maybe this could help us. We could learn something from this
incident.”
</p><!--l. 17972--><p class="indent" >  “Or from her.”
</p><!--l. 17975--><p class="indent" >  “So, does Bishop know?”
</p><!--l. 17977--><p class="indent" >  Is he serious, or humouring her?

<!--l. 17985--><p class="indent" >  Imagine being a bird, up there in the sky. The wind is blowing hard, buﬀeting you.
You&#x2019;re cold and dizzy with oxygen. Sore from the rushing of the air and wind. It is
this physical sensation that is missing from the VR. You cannot simulate that with
hardware, suits or visual cues. That kind of light, pervasive touch will never be
reproducible as a solitary experience.
</p><!--l. 17992--><p class="indent" >  Preeta has been hiding in the VR until now. But that is no escape. Freedom is not
given, it is taken. She feels dull and uninteresting in this grey winter world of Oslo.
She wants to shop, or get a manicure or do something feminine—anything. If she is
going to go out on the town, then she needs clothes. Being surrounded by these geeky
boys, who know nothing of adventure, does nothing for her self-esteem. She needs
that buﬀeting, that oxygen.

</p><!--l. 18000--><p class="indent" >  Lunch time is the time when the Norwegians ﬂock to consume what they profess to
be a form of food. Dark squares wrapped in noisy paper. It scarcely seems to be
plausible source of nourishment; fortunately, it is possible to opt out of these rituals.
Her absence will not be conspicuous.
</p><!--l. 18005--><p class="indent" >  During such cracks in their interface, she can plan small excursions into the
daylight city. Small trips build conﬁdence. Incremental moves, exploring, learning,
growing.
</p><!--l. 18009--><p class="indent" >  She wanders out of the Police building, into the shopping street. It is getting close
to Christmas and they shops are ﬁlling with bright decorations and insipid carols. Her
mobile is still new to her and there are grounds for caution; she is not used to the
advertising that streams, knocking against her ﬁrewall. She has been trying to exorcise
a stream of unwanted messages selling mobile-insurance for some days now.
Ironically, when she is out on the street, what she most needs is insurance against the
insurance.
</p><!--l. 18018--><p class="indent" >  She passes through the curtains of icy rain and ﬁnds her way into an arcade. Parasol
to paraply: she has learned, if nothing else, to carry an umbrella here. Rumour has it
that this is a place to buy perfume and clothing, straws to clutch to make her new self
complete.
</p><!--l. 18023--><p class="indent" >  The shops light up an inviting radiance in the rainy darkness. Little islands of
simulated humanity in a ﬁlm-noir daytime gloom. As hot air blasts down onto her
umbrella at the mall threshold, water ﬂies from its membrane and her mobile writhes
in a new deluge of incoming ads.

<!--l. 18041--><p class="noindent" >She clears the messages away like unwanted cobwebs and moves into shopping tunnel,
folding away the umbrella.
</p><!--l. 18044--><p class="indent" >  Three C&#x2019;s: clothes, cosmetics and cologne.

</p><!--l. 18046--><p class="indent" >  As the damp smell of ice and forest that blows down from Oslo&#x2019;s surrounding hills
is guillotined by the curtain of hot air at the mall&#x2019;s entrance threshold, the only new
smells she can sense are neither subtle nor sensual. Candy, cinnamon and hot raisins.
Not the sticky sweet smells of roasting Asian meats and fruits, this is a hot synthetic
sugar of a cultural desert. This is not a musk of intrigue and mystique. It is a sickly
and indulgent scent.
</p><!--l. 18054--><p class="indent" >  Through the shop windows, one can see people moving around. There is the
chatter in the air of people communing with distant voices. Assistants, on
show in the shops, are tidying and re-stocking. Sometimes they even help
the customers or assist them in their purchase transactions, but interactions
between people are at a minimum. There is no bartering here, no ceremony of
purchase.
</p><!--l. 18061--><p class="indent" >  She seems to have wandered in to the teenage end of the mall. It has a cartoony feel
to it, except for the ever-present signs of doctrine. Church advertising preys on
society&#x2019;s rediscovered loneliness, even for the young. People, inviting vulnerability,
and oﬀering themselves as sacriﬁcial servants mingle. It disturbs her, but is it any
wonder that the church still exists in this day and age, when society rejects even those
of kind?
</p><!--l. 18069--><p class="indent" >  <span

</p><!--l. 18073--><p class="indent" >  The badgering seems to be just another form of coercion. In Asia they look for
ways to turn people away from corruption and bribery. Here in the West, opposites
apply – it&#x2019;s about whom you can buy. Of course, the malls are pretty much the same,
both here and there, but she senses that people are more robust to the blatant messages
of marketing back home.
</p><!--l. 18080--><p class="indent" >  True?
</p><!--l. 18082--><p class="indent" >  Shouldn&#x2019;t assume it. Just a feeling.
</p><!--l. 18084--><p class="indent" >  Anyway, she should be trying to ﬁt in. This is a step towards her dream. Go forth.
Be a part of this town. That is the only way to know. That is what adventure is

</p><!--l. 18088--><p class="indent" >  Teenage kids are everywhere: they stand in the archway of the arcade, with a table
and a steaming metal press. Younger kids, not in school: <span

The arcade is not a dark grotto, given the faltering light outdoors: it sparkles
somewhat with artiﬁcial illumination. Someone talking into their glasses walks into
her.

<!--l. 18113--><p class="indent" >  Young girls walk in twos and threes, checking out clothing and gaming consoles, or
gossiping with friends, some in person, some via their mobiles. It seems normal. It
seems safe enough.
</p><!--l. 18117--><p class="indent" >  Preeta is starting to feel safe. She is slowly letting down her guard. It is
no longer necessary to look over her shoulder at every moment, wondering if
someone is out to destroy her, or abuse her, or abduct her. In Dermot&#x2019;s game, he
showed her creatures that could sniﬀ out a human being in a crowd, pin-point a
player and rush to the attack. Binolfactory, stereo smell, he called it. If such
creatures existed, they could ﬁnd her, even here, even in the camouﬂage of a
shopping mall. But she can rest assured that such things do not exist. Can&#x2019;t
she?
</p><!--l. 18128--><p class="indent" >  Would anyone even recognize her now? she wonders. She barely recognizes herself
in this country. Winter clothes, waterproof shoes. All these things have masked her
individuality and clothed her with some well-known brands. She looks like one of the
rest. She needs diﬀerent clothes, something more appealing. What about a new
scent? A perfume to make her irresistible? Or to dampen out the smell of
milk-sour sweat from the people in her group. There must be perfume shops
here.
</p><!--l. 18137--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t just stand there in the way! Fuck!”
</p><!--l. 18139--><p class="indent" >  Preeta&#x2019;s visual ﬁeld senses a stirring in the surfaces, a movement in the background
that covers the walls in between the luminous shop windows. It is not a moving
picture, it actually looks alive, and seems to change as she approaches. Adaptive
behaviour. That should not be happening here. The billboards should be static. Is it
nano-advertising? That is supposed to be illegal, isn&#x2019;t it? Maybe it is creeping in like
everything eventually does.

colour, signifying a change from teenage stores to a more grown-up battery of
retailers. This is where she really wants to be. The advertising adapts as she crosses

shifting poses. She tries to imagine her body naked before a mirror, except for a
white-lace thong. But it makes her look fat. Her hips are wider than any of these
ﬁgures. She admires the young women around her; they are narrower, but
even they would have trouble conforming to the dimensions of this display
item.
</p><!--l. 18177--><p class="indent" >  Her mobile is still being bombarded with information from the shops around her.
She dares not to risk opening the barriers to see if there are more sizes in stock, at
least not on this occasion. Small steps, incremental growth. Underwear can
wait.
</p><!--l. 18182--><p class="indent" >  The shifting current herds her into a corner and she is forced to push her way out,
past tall Norwegian bodies in warm coats. She ends up in a dark tunnel of living
surfaces, where there are fewer bodies in motion. It is calmer here. The walls, roof
and ﬂoor are all glowing with information, animation and imagery. Most
of it is for shoppers or travellers; there are news items and public notices
too.

<!--l. 18197--><p class="indent" >  A short video sequence, on the ﬂoor in front of her, shows news coverage of a
crowd that has gathered in downtown Oslo, not far away from the arcade. Foreign
culturals have gathered on the street, seeking a togetherness that is absent from their
daily lives. The reportage shows that the faces are all dark and non-native. She expects
that native Norwegians would all be in their isolation tanks, demonstrating from the
comfort of their mobiles.

</p><!--l. 18205--><p class="indent" >  She stands for a while, absorbing the information, and watching the style of the
imagery. It is nothing like what she knows from Asia. Nor does it resemble what she
has seen from American broadcasts. She stays there to watch for a few moments.
She&#x2019;ll have to get back to work very soon.
</p><!--l. 18211--><p class="indent" >  Then a shadow passes over where she is standing. It is an angel ﬂuttering in the
smart screen, above her head. She has been standing still for too long and the angels
are programmed to close in on people standing. Perhaps it thinks she is a vagrant and
has come to save her soul. Christian mythology has become an integral part of
marketing now. It is the same in Asia, of course, but the Hindu gods are cooler and
look better in the fashion-wear of the region.
</p><!--l. 18219--><p class="indent" >  Still, new imagery makes interesting watching. She has never seen this kind of
catholic propaganda before, not in such detail. The graphics are impressive. The angel
is trying to send an audio signal to her mobile, but her barriers are preventing it. Let&#x2019;s
not go there.
</p><!--l. 18225--><p class="indent" >  Multitudes of services are hiding in these walls, surely. She can see them with her
mobile, conﬁgured in scan mode. There are so many transactions between the smart
walls and the passing mobiles that it must be costing people a stash of money to just
walk through this trading tunnel. Most of them probably have no idea what they are
paying for, or what they are getting: a faithful umbilical, serving them their
dose.
</p><!--l. 18233--><p class="indent" >  Preeta feels exhausted already. She ducks into a clothing store to escape the current
of bodies. Relative calm presides here, except for the thumping of some popular
music. The piles of garments oﬀer a sense of comfort. A young girl, standing at the
rear end of the narrow shop, indicates that she has seen her come in but does not come
to her assistance. That suits her ﬁne.
</p><!--l. 18240--><p class="indent" >  The clothes are fashionable; there is nothing here for an older audience. Bright
colours and adaptive shades, synthetics and designer jeans. Blue jeans are back
again.
</p><!--l. 18244--><p class="indent" >  She takes a moment to breath and ﬁnd her inner calm. The girl is eyeing her from
the back of the shop.
</p><!--l. 18247--><p class="indent" >  She sees a pair of trousers and a top that she likes. They are black. It seems like a
statement of daring, given her dark complexion, but perhaps that is what she needs: to
feel as though she stands out. Do not cower all your life, she thinks. Think of life here
as you would think of a game room. Be bold.
</p><!--l. 18253--><p class="indent" >  She downloads the details of the clothes to her mobile. Perhaps she will order them
by post later. For now, small things.
</p><!--l. 18256--><p class="indent" >  She picks out a tightly-ﬁtting T-shirt top, of the kind that clings to the body and
makes one&#x2019;s breasts stand out, it looks great on the wriggling mannikins, and the size
will adapt to her. It seems like a safe buy, even if she can&#x2019;t ﬁnd anything to go with it.
She ought to be buying warm clothes, but with a new jacket, this is still wearable.
Who needs sensible clothes anyway?
</p><!--l. 18263--><p class="indent" >  She takes the garment to the back of the shop, feeling that she ought to buy
something, as the only customer. The girl smiles broadly as she receives the garment

and begins wrapping it absently. A display of bangles, on the side of the counter,
attracts her attention.
</p><!--l. 18268--><p class="indent" >  “Oh, this is just like a bracelet that I had when I was a girl!”
</p><!--l. 18270--><p class="indent" >  The girl glances at her from the corner of an uncertain eye. Seeing that she is
talking to her, her smile drops like a tossed pancake onto a cold ﬂoor; brow
furrows with suspicion. Are you talking to me? She completes the transaction
with a winced smile, and Preeta is dismissed. Apparently, she has crossed a
boundary.
</p><!--l. 18276--><p class="indent" >  She leaves quickly back into the media tunnel.
</p><!--l. 18279--><p class="indent" >  The smart walls seem to be tied into the game. They probably belong to a gaming
shop close to the end of this passage. Some of the billboards have errors in them: there
are clear signs of image corruption in some of the billboards. The sickness has
reached here too. It brings her down to Earth. Time is moving on. She should get back
to the group.
</p><!--l. 18287--><p class="indent" >  She moves back into the ﬂow of people and is almost carried through the arcade to
the exit and ejected back into the street, next to what looks like cloisters of a
church.
</p><!--l. 18291--><p class="indent" >  A turn of her head reveals her casual reﬂection in a mirrored panel, surrounding the
portal of the shopping tunnel. Her new clothes still look unfamiliar to her. She looks
like a man, but for her long, dark hair. Winter clothing hides her femininity even more
than the customs of her past life. Somehow, she envisioned herself in a diﬀerent style.
There will be time for that later.
</p><!--l. 18298--><p class="indent" >  Winter cannot last here for ever.
</p><!--l. 18301--><p class="indent" >  Preeta steps out, almost into the path of an African Muslim woman with a huge
backside, pushing a pram. She is surrounded by an entourage of miniature children.
The image looks suddenly absurd. Compared to these Westerners, she is a bowling
skittle, donned up in that Sharia garb of khaki brown. Is this the secret weapon of
Mohammed? A militia of giant Muslim bowling skittles with prams to inﬁltrate the
West.
</p><!--l. 18308--><p class="indent" >  Suddenly, Preeta does not feel so unglamorous.

<!--l. 18316--><p class="indent" >  Dermot greets her cordially, as though they have never met. Bishop has arranged a
meeting of the group. A couple of days has passed since she sparred with Dermot
in his game. She remembers him well enough. Has he forgotten how she
looks?
</p><!--l. 18322--><p class="indent" >  “Bishop is here,” someone announces.
</p><!--l. 18324--><p class="indent" >  “Anyone know what he wants?”
</p><!--l. 18326--><p class="indent" >  “He wants to heal the world, my son.”

</p><!--l. 18328--><p class="indent" >  Nina laughs, “Do you think he qualiﬁes as a fanatic?”
</p><!--l. 18330--><p class="indent" >  They laugh covertly at his expense, as Bishop strolls in, unaware or untouched by
the jokes. His mind is apparently elsewhere. Art Haugen, the police liason, follows
him in. They both seem relaxed and cheerful.
</p><!--l. 18334--><p class="indent" >  Bishop sees Dermot and Preeta sit down together, as the small group congregates
around the table. “So you two should be working together.” It is not clear whether it is
an order, a statement of expectation or a question.
</p><!--l. 18339--><p class="indent" >  Dermot&#x2019;s discomfort simmers beneath his nonchalance. His body language is
stuttering, as if he has been hauled in against his will. “Uh — I&#x2019;m actually working on
something else.” He immediately seems to regret saying it.
</p><!--l. 18344--><p class="indent" >  “Something tells me that you could be working together anyway.” This time the
order is clear.
</p><!--l. 18347--><p class="indent" >  Dermot nods, face practically in his sweater.
</p><!--l. 18349--><p class="indent" >  “I think we have some things in common,” Preeta poses constructively.
</p><!--l. 18351--><p class="indent" >  “Sure.”
</p><!--l. 18354--><p class="indent" >  “I have been wanting to talk with you,” Preeta tells him.
</p><!--l. 18356--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ve been attending a police seminar in Santa Monica.”
</p><!--l. 18358--><p class="indent" >  “I didn&#x2019;t know you had been away. I&#x2019;m sorry.”
</p><!--l. 18360--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ve been here. I was attending by VR, but that means sleeping at odd
times.”
</p><!--l. 18362--><p class="indent" >  “Oh, stupid me.”
</p><!--l. 18364--><p class="indent" >  “Cheaper and quicker, if not perfect. Art was with me.”
</p><!--l. 18366--><p class="indent" >  Art Haugen nods, his eyebrows raised. “Frankly, I would prefer to have made the
trip. I&#x2019;m strictly a beat-cop by nature.”
</p><!--l. 18369--><p class="indent" >  “Our meeting has raised some issues that we need to deal with, folks. We need to
speed up our virus work.”
</p><!--l. 18372--><p class="indent" >  “What does that mean?”
</p><!--l. 18374--><p class="indent" >  “It means we need to coordinate. Dermot,” Bishop directs. “We need to make your
work a matter of priority.”
</p><!--l. 18377--><p class="indent" >  “Has something changed?” Jonathan asks.
</p><!--l. 18379--><p class="indent" >  “There is an Interpol warning out. Intelligence from the U.S. tells us that the
Christian lobby is about to make an oﬀensive that is aimed at exploiting a loophole in
regulations. That means we need your countermeasures prepared. How is that
going?”
</p><!--l. 18384--><p class="indent" >  “This comes as a bit of a surprise,” he deﬂects. “I thought we had more
time.”
</p><!--l. 18387--><p class="indent" >  “It is not a surprise, just a bit inconvenient.”
</p><!--l. 18389--><p class="indent" >  “What form is this oﬀensive going to take?”
</p><!--l. 18391--><p class="indent" >  “We don&#x2019;t know that yet. There are leaks about a possible new bill for congress and
a ballot, combined with a big media campaign.”
</p><!--l. 18394--><p class="indent" >  “And the religions of the world have been hijacked by despotic regimes and the
clergy. Oops, I mean the U.S. government!”
</p><!--l. 18397--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah? What about the Muslim countries?”

</p><!--l. 18399--><p class="indent" >  “Focus please,” Bishop commands, as if used to dealing with a group of unruly
children. “Our friends in the States need our help, not our judgement at this
stage.”
</p><!--l. 18404--><p class="indent" >  “Actually, we are having enough of a situation right now tracing the roots of the
gang violence that is blossoming.”
</p><!--l. 18407--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m aware of that.”
</p><!--l. 18410--><p class="indent" >  “It never rains, but it pours.”
</p><!--l. 18412--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t see where any extra resources are going to come from.”
</p><!--l. 18414--><p class="indent" >  Bishop stays focused on his goals, looking past the obstacles. “So, Dermot, how are
you doing?”
</p><!--l. 18417--><p class="indent" >  He squirms, barely visibly.
</p><!--l. 18419--><p class="indent" >  Preeta observes that Dermot is not the same conﬁdent ﬁgure that he was in the VR.
He seems ill at ease. His body language cries out that he has not done something that
he was supposed to do. If the others notice this, they do not let on, except perhaps for
Bishop who seems to give up.
</p><!--l. 18424--><p class="indent" >  “Why is there a honeypot?” Preeta interjects.
</p><!--l. 18426--><p class="indent" >  Bishop: “Honeypot?”
</p><!--l. 18428--><p class="indent" >  “I was looking through some of the data and I found a police honeypot, linked to
Interpol.”
</p><!--l. 18431--><p class="indent" >  “Not my area,” Bishop shrugs. “You should ask the operations people on the
computer crime team.”
</p><!--l. 18434--><p class="indent" >  She nods.
</p><!--l. 18436--><p class="indent" >  “So this coming action is coming from where?”
</p><!--l. 18438--><p class="indent" >  Dermot nods to her, covertly. Presumably it is his way of saying thank
you.
</p><!--l. 18440--><p class="indent" >  “The Christian lobby has apparently put up a lot of money to extend their
campaign. They have the resources now to dominate the media in the U.S.. Other
factions in the game consortium are ﬁghting back. The FBI is asking for us to be on
our guard, especially here in Scandinavia where the evangelist churches have roots of
their own. There is also talk of something they are holding as a closely guarded secret,
maybe coming soon. We are being asked to stay alert to make sure they don&#x2019;t pull a
fast one.”
</p><!--l. 18449--><p class="indent" >  “Which means we have to pull out the stops?”
</p><!--l. 18451--><p class="indent" >  “Small country, time on our hands.”
</p><!--l. 18453--><p class="indent" >  “And all our ﬂying pigs.”
</p><!--l. 18455--><p class="indent" >  “What?”
</p><!--l. 18457--><p class="indent" >  “They wait until we are busy with an upsurge in gang activities.”
</p><!--l. 18459--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s just a little suspicious, don&#x2019;t you think? Just a little coordinated?” Ivar
bristles. “I&#x2019;ll bet they arranged the violence as a distraction.”
</p><!--l. 18463--><p class="indent" >  “Let&#x2019;s not get too paranoid. It&#x2019;s the other factions who have generally been
promoting interest in violence. The Christian lobby is ﬁghting them, as far as we can
tell.”
</p><!--l. 18467--><p class="indent" >  “So what kind of campaign are they going to mount?”

</p><!--l. 18469--><p class="indent" >  “We don&#x2019;t know that, I&#x2019;m afraid.”
</p><!--l. 18471--><p class="indent" >  “With all their resources, they are going to have an advantage. It&#x2019;s a strong signal
and it will be coming out in a pretty noisy background.”
</p><!--l. 18475--><p class="indent" >  “So wipe it out.”
</p><!--l. 18477--><p class="indent" >  “With what?”
</p><!--l. 18479--><p class="indent" >  “You tell us. That&#x2019;s why we hire you egg-heads,” Haugen says.
</p><!--l. 18481--><p class="indent" >  “You are all smart people, but I want you to focus on the job now. Let&#x2019;s drop the
conspiracy theories and prejudices and stick to what we know.”
</p><!--l. 18485--><p class="indent" >  “What about an anti-signal? Like sound-neutralizing headphones? What do you
think?”
</p><!--l. 18488--><p class="indent" >  “Make it work and I&#x2019;ll let you know.”
</p><!--l. 18490--><p class="indent" >  “What are the alternatives?”
</p><!--l. 18492--><p class="indent" >  Preeta opens her mouth to speak, but stops short of actual words.
</p><!--l. 18494--><p class="indent" >  “Surely the easiest place to stop it is at source. Can&#x2019;t they do something in the U.S.
to make the campaign illegal?”
</p><!--l. 18497--><p class="indent" >  “The campaign is already illegal. The point is that they are not following the rules.
They are powerful enough to avoid the repercussions.”
</p><!--l. 18500--><p class="indent" >  “Classic corruption scenario.”
</p><!--l. 18502--><p class="indent" >  “Isn&#x2019;t the police powerful too?”
</p><!--l. 18504--><p class="indent" >  “Yes and no. The F.B.I. has orders from government to back oﬀ.”
</p><!--l. 18506--><p class="indent" >  “So if no one else is following orders. . .”
</p><!--l. 18508--><p class="indent" >  “Ivar, if the police force is not seen to obey the chain of command, they
would be shooting themselves in the foot. Anything they do has to be oﬀ the
record.”
</p><!--l. 18512--><p class="indent" >  “So they&#x2019;re shutting us all down?”
</p><!--l. 18514--><p class="indent" >  “No. They can&#x2019;t. They can only shut down the FBI. But that means we have to help
them from the outside.”
</p><!--l. 18517--><p class="indent" >  “Conspiracy nuts are going to love this.”
</p><!--l. 18519--><p class="indent" >  Bishop underlines once again. “This overrides our other activities. There is some
urgency to this. They have the technology to dominate billboards, smart surfaces and
any environmental scenery in the game. That might not sound like much, but we
already know that this is what starts the ball rolling. Once they have momentum, it
becomes a locomotive.”
</p><!--l. 18525--><p class="indent" >  “We&#x2019;ll need Preeta&#x2019;s help. She knows how the rendering works, and she has taught
us to follow the players&#x2019; lifelines.”
</p><!--l. 18528--><p class="indent" >  She nods. “But you know, to be honest, I&#x2019;m not convinced that they can do
it.”
</p><!--l. 18530--><p class="indent" >  “Let&#x2019;s not take that chance.”
</p><!--l. 18532--><p class="indent" >  Bishop concludes. “All right, folks. Go to work. We&#x2019;ll talk again as soon as I know
more. But please do your best on this.”
</p><!--l. 18535--><p class="indent" >  The group splits and Preeta turns to Dermot. “So are we working together?”
</p><!--l. 18538--><p class="indent" >  He shrugs. “It probably makes sense.”
</p><!--l. 18540--><p class="indent" >  She smiles. “And don&#x2019;t forget you&#x2019;re coming out with us tomorrow. ”

</p><!--l. 18542--><p class="indent" >  He frowns. “We&#x2019;ll see.” Then he gets up and ﬂees.
</p><!--l. 18544--><p class="indent" >  She marshals her spinning thoughts. New urgency presides, but is there any point to
it, when the whole game is self-destructing? How can they put into more messages
when the system is already maxed out? Frankly, she would rather ﬁnd out what is
going on at home.
</p><!--l. 18549--><p class="indent" >  “Mr. Bishop, can I please talk to you?”

</p><!--l. 18556--><p class="indent" >  The helicopter apparently touched down, at a ground station, somewhere unfamiliar
to her. The recollection is fuzzy. She was half asleep. Someone carried Vibe out of the
cabin and put her into a car. There was driving, sharp swings, and she does not
remember anything else, except for a feverish confusion.
</p><!--l. 18562--><p class="indent" >  In a dream someone asked her:
</p><!--l. 18564--><p class="indent" >  “Would you like a room for the night?”
</p><!--l. 18566--><p class="indent" >  Not really. But necessary. “Yes.”
</p><!--l. 18568--><p class="indent" >  They are in a mountain cabin hotel. It is a luxurious place. Frank is here with her,
and Peter Green is sitting by the ﬁreplace. She goes towards him and stands close to
the sofa where he is sitting.
</p><!--l. 18572--><p class="indent" >  “We&#x2019;ll be here by ourselves for an hour or two yet.”
</p><!--l. 18574--><p class="indent" >  “Sara?”
</p><!--l. 18576--><p class="indent" >  “Yes?”
</p><!--l. 18578--><p class="indent" >  “Are you okay?”
</p><!--l. 18580--><p class="indent" >  She sags a little and ﬂashes a half-hearted smile, more a purse of the lips in one
corner of her face. She is exhausted.
</p><!--l. 18583--><p class="indent" >  “Come here.”
</p><!--l. 18585--><p class="indent" >  He puts his arms around her legs and his hand slides up under her skirt, almost
matter of factly, she sags and melts and bends down to kiss him. It is Frank sitting
there, not Peter Green.
</p><!--l. 18590--><p class="indent" >  “Make love to me,” he says.
</p><!--l. 18592--><p class="indent" >  “I need to check my messages,” she says. “Excuse me.”

<!--l. 18599--><p class="indent" >  Daylight, silvery and uncertain. It is a welcome relief from the dark murmurings of
a fever. For a moment, when she woke, she seemed certain that she was lying in her
bivvy bag, up on the mountainside. The bedclothes are damp around her from the
sweat of illness. But the bed is soft and forgiving.
</p><!--l. 18605--><p class="indent" >  It is quiet here. The air seems to have swallowed sound, but for a distant clanking of
a chimney ﬁn. There is a vague aroma of wood burning somewhere. She sees that
Bea has been trying to call her, but she has been ﬂoating in feverish sensory
deprivation.
</p><!--l. 18610--><p class="indent" >  She peels the salty, sopping duvet from her body and tries to sit.
</p><!--l. 18612--><p class="indent" >  A window, with thin curtains is letting enough light to bring her fully to
consciousness. She ﬁnds herself in a medium-sized room with walls of typical
Norwegian cabin panelling – sun-darkened light-wood.
</p><!--l. 18616--><p class="indent" >  Someone has undressed her and put her into some way-baggy pyjamas. A thought
makes her heart skip a beat and she reaches down to check. Then the memory starts to
return. Someone has changed her. . .no, she did it herself. The humiliation of having
someone else clean up her monthly leaching will not compound her misery. Be
grateful for small mercies.
</p><!--l. 18623--><p class="indent" >  A nagging sensation informs her that she ought to be worried about something, but
the body is still too weak to support such a fervour. She suﬃces to lie on her back
feeling tired and weak in every part of her battered body.
</p><!--l. 18628--><p class="indent" >  She must have been here several hours, since yesterday? Is it morning?
</p><!--l. 18630--><p class="indent" >  She rises as carefully as she can and goes into the bathroom, located behind
a sliding door next to the bed. It feels good to be back in civilization after
exposure to more rugged surroundings. The underﬂoor heating soothes the
sores on her feet. Her calves and shin-muscles ache. She staggers like an old
woman.
</p><!--l. 18636--><p class="indent" >  She makes it back to the bed, but by now the sweat has grown cold and the damp
covers are uninviting. She needs clean sheets if she is going to stay there. She scans
around for her clothes and sees them folded up on a chair in the corner of
the room, along with her rucksack. She should probably get dressed. She
pulls some easy training clothes out of her pack, some light shoes and starts
the sluggish process of folding her body into maneuvers that ought to be
straightforward.
</p><!--l. 18644--><p class="indent" >  She creeps, like something between a tortoise and a stick-insect, to the door of the
little room and looks out into the corridor. The ﬂoor is wooden and cold. There is a
damp, limey smell that tells her she is still in the mountains. The smell of a drying
room ﬁlled with mountain clothing and earthen fumes. This seems to be a cabin or
hotel of some kind.
</p><!--l. 18651--><p class="indent" >  Along the corridor, she can hear activity. She places one foot in front of the other
until she is in some kind of reception.
</p><!--l. 18654--><p class="indent" >  Frank is not here, but his partner is sitting in the lounge area writing something.
</p><!--l. 18657--><p class="indent" >  “How are you feeling?”
</p><!--l. 18659--><p class="indent" >  “I feel awful.”

</p><!--l. 18661--><p class="indent" >  “Welcome to our impromptu base of operations.”
</p><!--l. 18663--><p class="indent" >  “Where are we?”
</p><!--l. 18665--><p class="indent" >  “Not all that far from Gjendesheim. We have are using this place as a point of
contact, and as an inﬁrmary for you. You seem to have come down with a
bug.”
</p><!--l. 18669--><p class="indent" >  She laughs. Understatement of the millennium.
</p><!--l. 18672--><p class="indent" >  “Did we catch the bad guys?”
</p><!--l. 18674--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m afraid you passed out on us.”
</p><!--l. 18676--><p class="indent" >  “Where are we?”
</p><!--l. 18678--><p class="indent" >  “Mountain Rescue. Looks like they ﬁnally caught up with you.”
</p><!--l. 18680--><p class="indent" >  She laughs again, yawning at the same time.
</p><!--l. 18682--><p class="indent" >  “Someone is looking for you,” he says.
</p><!--l. 18684--><p class="indent" >  “Who?”
</p><!--l. 18686--><p class="indent" >  “Someone called Lindgren.”
</p><!--l. 18688--><p class="indent" >  She breaths out deeply and then pants for a while in relief. “Did you tell him where
I am?”
</p><!--l. 18691--><p class="indent" >  “Of course.”
</p><!--l. 18693--><p class="indent" >  “I should call my mum too.”
</p><!--l. 18695--><p class="indent" >  “We can take you somewhere where you can catch a bus if you want. But we&#x2019;ll
need to ask you some questions ﬁrst.”
</p><!--l. 18698--><p class="indent" >  “I let you down. I was supposed to help ﬁnd the remaining . . . the stragglers.”
</p><!--l. 18700--><p class="indent" >  “Not to worry. We&#x2019;ve got help from the army now.”
</p><!--l. 18702--><p class="indent" >  “The army?”
</p><!--l. 18704--><p class="indent" >  He nods. “They have certain skills that us police-folks don&#x2019;t have.”
</p><!--l. 18706--><p class="indent" >  She ﬂops down into an opposing chair. “Any chance of a cup of tea?”

<!--l. 18713--><p class="indent" >  Sara Stensrud seems to have been under the covers for days now. The shivering and
the shaking have passed into aching lethargy.
</p><!--l. 18716--><p class="indent" >  Her body has been waging war on insurgents that have invaded her, selﬁshly
waving around their unauthorized DNA slogans in her private cells.
</p><!--l. 18720--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Don&#x2019;t post bills in my bloodstream assholes.</span>
</p><!--l. 18722--><p class="indent" >  In the ﬁnal analysis, she knows that this is her own fault, the result of her
own misadventure. She has not slept very well. She has not eaten very well.
She has been hot and cold and hot and cold. . . It is the ideal way to break
down her defences to junk DNA that is circulating on the recesses of her
body.
</p><!--l. 18728--><p class="indent" >  She is feeling better. Stronger.

</p><!--l. 18730--><p class="indent" >  They have been asking her questions about the VeiVeks and about what she saw of
the gangs. At one point, a police commander came and gave her a stern talking-to
about irresponsible behaviour.
</p><!--l. 18734--><p class="indent" >  She tells them about her project and about the warning that Dr. Lindgren gave her.
They inspect her mobile and ﬁnd a surveillance virus. She ﬁlls out some forms and
tries to call home.
</p><!--l. 18739--><p class="indent" >  She spends an hour playing the game, in one of the low level battle sims. She needs
to limber up after her ordeal. Some good-old mindless gaming is good for her state of
mind. She does not exactly cream at the idea of maiming and killing, not like her
brother, but it feels good to expunge some aggression.
</p><!--l. 18745--><p class="indent" >  Physically, she needs the rest, but mentally she needs to let oﬀ some steam, to
lash out at someone—a kind of inverted game rage, apparently. The muscles
down her back are aching, and she feels tired. The instinct to sleep is still
strong, but her stubbornness overrides it. Probably she has now slept very
well.
</p><!--l. 18751--><p class="indent" >  They ﬁght hand to hand, or with weapons. She shoots and kicks at the phantasms of
the LinearAssault Castle Keep. They fall or they melt or they explode into
the oblivion of relief. It does not bother her that the game designers have
made all of the enemies look like Bedouin nomads, or Chinese assassins.
She would have preferred it if they had looked like the French team, but her
imagination is good enough to think of them as French team with plastic
surgery.
</p><!--l. 18759--><p class="indent" >  Maybe she would exclude Peter Green. Or maybe they should all look like him. A
quick back-ﬂip and a kick to the jaw. Follow up with a laser pulse. A quick death, ﬁfty
points.
</p><!--l. 18763--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">What the hell am I still thinking about here?</span>
</p><!--l. 18765--><p class="indent" >  Does he even know what is going on? He doesn&#x2019;t know that she is here, or who she
is.
</p><!--l. 18768--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Fuck him! Why should I care.</span>
</p><!--l. 18770--><p class="indent" >  Fuck him? What would that be like?
</p><!--l. 18773--><p class="indent" >  She feels depressed for the ﬁrst time in a long time. This is not the way things were
supposed to happen. She could call Bea to broadcast her humiliation, but for once she
just wants a little privacy.
</p><!--l. 18777--><p class="indent" >  So she goes to Plovdiv and enters the sims without Bea. She goes to kick ass and
blow up tanks. This time she wants to see how bad her morality score can
be.

</p><!--l. 18788--><p class="indent" >  “What are you doing up at this hour?”
</p><!--l. 18790--><p class="indent" >  “Couldn&#x2019;t sleep.” She has been sleeping for most of the day. He looks weary, but
calm. His voice is soft and comfortable.
</p><!--l. 18794--><p class="indent" >  There is no denying that she is fascinated. Whatever. He has a way about him. But
she didn&#x2019;t come here to meet him. What the hell is he doing confusing her like this?
She has been thinking about the French team for so long that she must at least
try to see them before changing her obsession. But she could have this one
now.
</p><!--l. 18801--><p class="indent" >  He gestures to her mobile bits and pieces lying on the table in front of
her.
</p><!--l. 18803--><p class="indent" >  “What&#x2019;s this?”
</p><!--l. 18805--><p class="indent" >  “Trying to work. I found out that I was able to reach some of the VeiVeks again by
regular net.”
</p><!--l. 18808--><p class="indent" >  He raises his eyebrows as if to politely ask if that is good.
</p><!--l. 18810--><p class="indent" >  “That means I can see what is going on again.”
</p><!--l. 18812--><p class="indent" >  “Good news?”
</p><!--l. 18814--><p class="indent" >  “Not really. The guide robots have all gone into the same state,” she say. “There
could be a bug somewhere. If I were feeling fresher, I could make a work around,
but I am not really up to it. I was just interested in why it would happen at
all.”
</p><!--l. 18819--><p class="indent" >  “So what are they doing?”
</p><!--l. 18821--><p class="indent" >  “Some of them are gravitating to one particular route through the mountains, and
others are going oﬀ at random. They seem to have decided this of their own
accord.” She heaves a sigh. “To be honest I haven&#x2019;t got the energy to care right
now.”
</p><!--l. 18826--><p class="indent" >  He reaches forward and puts his palm on her forehead.
</p><!--l. 18828--><p class="indent" >  “You&#x2019;re still unwell. You should be resting.”
</p><!--l. 18830--><p class="indent" >  She nods. “I was about to go back and sleep. What about you?” <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Do you want to join</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">me? </span>“Don&#x2019;t you get to sleep?”
</p><!--l. 18833--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m ﬁnished now. Our team will stay here tonight and wait for new orders
tomorrow. I think we&#x2019;re done here.”
</p><!--l. 18836--><p class="indent" >  “I can take her down to the dungeon.”
</p><!--l. 18838--><p class="indent" >  Another police uniform enters. She recognizes the face. It&#x2019;s the single-mother
beat-bitch who accosted her at the train-station. Vibe scowls.
</p><!--l. 18843--><p class="indent" >  “So you came back.” Her tone is something between sarcasm and malignant
nonchalance.
</p><!--l. 18846--><p class="indent" >  Vibe doesn&#x2019;t answer.
</p><!--l. 18848--><p class="indent" >  “Thought for a moment there, you didn&#x2019;t listen to my advice.”
</p><!--l. 18850--><p class="indent" >  “Have you come to get me? Am I in some kind of trouble?”
</p><!--l. 18852--><p class="indent" >  “Someone is going to want to talk to you. About your extra-curricular activities.
But not tonight.”
</p><!--l. 18855--><p class="indent" >  Vibe looks at Frank, questioningly.
</p><!--l. 18857--><p class="indent" >  “We are just clocking oﬀ. It&#x2019;s time to get some sleep.”

</p><!--l. 18859--><p class="indent" >  The woman about-turns and goes to the reception desk to check in.
</p><!--l. 18862--><p class="indent" >  Vibe has spent a lot of time recording and understanding facial expressions. She has
an unusually expressive face. Why else would she get her way in most cases? She is
an expert manipulator. But this woman&#x2019;s face is dead. Lifeless. She is a robot. Maybe
she can be switched oﬀ.

before it starts. After that, we might not be able to get out at all.”
</p><!--l. 18893--><p class="indent" >  It has snowed several centimetres during the night and the air is still spitting small
icy snowﬂakes. The road outside has been cleared, and now seems abandoned.
Wispy white powder gusts across it, like a bleached western movie. Saloon
doors ﬂap and gun ﬁghters face each other as tumbleweed rolls into giant
snowballs.
</p><!--l. 18899--><p class="indent" >  She has spent the last hour beaming pictures of the scene outside the window of the

</p><!--l. 18904--><p class="indent" >  “And bruise my perfect behind? Are you losing it?”

</p><!--l. 18908--><p class="indent" >  Frank strolls in, letting in a blast of cold mountain air and a ﬂurry of snow. He is
wearing a uniform today. It is pretty sexy, she thinks.

</p><!--l. 18923--><p class="indent" >  “Oh?”
</p><!--l. 18925--><p class="indent" >  She lifts a hand towards the window. “The weather probably. Or maybe someone
has taken them out of service.”
</p><!--l. 18928--><p class="indent" >  “Well, glad to hear that you are on the mend.”
</p><!--l. 18930--><p class="indent" >  “So are you driving me to the bus station? Should I pack?”

calling?”
</p><!--l. 18949--><p class="indent" >  He shrugs. “No one tells me anything,”
</p><!--l. 18951--><p class="indent" >  “I should get back to Oslo.”
</p><!--l. 18953--><p class="indent" >  “Paramedic said you should rest a while. The plan is to move you closer to the main

</p><!--l. 18957--><p class="indent" >  “Now?”
</p><!--l. 18959--><p class="indent" >  “As soon as you can get ready.”
</p><!--l. 18961--><p class="indent" >  “But I should take a shower and make myself look presentable. . .”
</p><!--l. 18963--><p class="indent" >  “Never mind that. You look ﬁne.”
</p><!--l. 18965--><p class="indent" >  He puts his hand on her shoulder. Her heart skips a beat. She scowls and shakes it
free. What was that? Doesn&#x2019;t he realize that she is attracted to him? Idiot! She
turns away from him and goes to stand at the window, facing out into neutral
territory.
</p><!--l. 18970--><p class="indent" >  “I look awful.”
</p><!--l. 18972--><p class="indent" >  His partner enters, letting in another blast of freezing air.
</p><!--l. 18974--><p class="indent" >  “Are we ready?”

<!--l. 18982--><p class="indent" >  The car crackles slowly along the swinging road, ploughing through the light
snowfall. The wind is gusting a little today, and the road is relatively clear, so far.
They make slow but steady progress along the mountain road. The snow plough has
been here to make a token eﬀort, but soon this road will be closed for the winter.
After an hour of driving, there is descent into a valley, where the road is
clearer.
</p><!--l. 18990--><p class="indent" >  “So what are you doing here really? At this time of year?”
</p><!--l. 18992--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m not supposed to be here at all,” she sulks.
</p><!--l. 18994--><p class="indent" >  “But you&#x2019;re here.”

</p><!--l. 18996--><p class="indent" >  She nods. “There is a team of French engineers who built these robots. They are
testing them, and I am supposed to get data from their tests, since I wrote a lot of the
reasoning algorithms. But then they suddenly went weird on me and said they were
pulling out. Then they literally just disappeared, leaving me pretty screwed—pardon
my French.”
</p><!--l. 19002--><p class="indent" >  “So you came here looking for them?”
</p><!--l. 19004--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s my mum&#x2019;s fault. She is a woman of action. I suppose I take after her a bit. It
seemed like a good idea at the time.”
</p><!--l. 19007--><p class="indent" >  “What, just to come here out of the blue?”
</p><!--l. 19009--><p class="indent" >  She shakes her head. “Huh uh. You see, Mrs. Laurent, the team leader—I think she
likes me. So she said I should come out as quickly as I could.”
</p><!--l. 19012--><p class="indent" >  “And here you are.”
</p><!--l. 19014--><p class="indent" >  “I came to try to make contact with the team who has been testing out the hardware
of the VeiVeks—my robots.”
</p><!--l. 19021--><p class="indent" >  “Sure, they have as many applications as you want. Tourism, exploration, search
and rescue, surveillance, maintenance, gardening. . .”
</p><!--l. 19024--><p class="indent" >  “They use adaptive game theory to reason.”
</p><!--l. 19026--><p class="indent" >  “What&#x2019;s that for a game of soldiers?”
</p><!--l. 19028--><p class="indent" >  “Ugh. It&#x2019;s like optimization. Tells you how to make good compromises, if you have
a rough idea of how your opponents think.”
</p><!--l. 19031--><p class="indent" >  “Sounds like something for a police force.”
</p><!--l. 19033--><p class="indent" >  “Maybe.”
</p><!--l. 19035--><p class="indent" >  “Stupid comment, huh?”
</p><!--l. 19037--><p class="indent" >  “No,” she shakes her head moodily. “I&#x2019;m not really an expert.” She shrugs. “I&#x2019;m a
user, not a dealer.”
</p><!--l. 19042--><p class="indent" >  Mountain scenery is bleak but stunning. Even the best game graphics cannot match
the experience of such a sight. At one point, she rolls down the window to remove the
glass barrier between her and the outside world. If you want to enjoy reality, you
cannot shield yourself from it.
</p><!--l. 19050--><p class="indent" >  She feels cold, dizzy and her body still aches. She needs sleep. The cold ﬁngers of
fever are tickling her again.

<!--l. 19060--><p class="indent" >  As if the result of her premonition, a man is waiting for them when they arrive. An
American, waiting impatiently to go just outside the doorway of the hotel. He seems
anxious to leave.
</p><!--l. 19064--><p class="indent" >  Vibe&#x2019;s fury is contained only by her exhaustion.
</p><!--l. 19067--><p class="indent" >  “Hello, I am clearing up for the ESA team. I heard your were looking for them, and
I have something for you.”

</p><!--l. 19071--><p class="indent" >  She measures her response with all of the control she can muster. “Have you seen
them?”
</p><!--l. 19074--><p class="indent" >  “No, I was brought in to clear up the equipment. I wasn&#x2019;t told when they left. Wait a
minute, I have something for you.”
</p><!--l. 19080--><p class="indent" >  He seems to be waiting to leave, with boxes loaded onto a trailer. He returns with a
small cubical box, sealed with tape.
</p><!--l. 19083--><p class="indent" >  “Is that the swarm?” she hisses, pointing to the boxes.
</p><!--l. 19085--><p class="indent" >  “All the ones I could recover.”
</p><!--l. 19087--><p class="indent" >  “I am supposed to give this to you in person. Can I have your ID?”

</p><!--l. 19095--><p class="indent" >  ”Do you know where they are now?”
</p><!--l. 19097--><p class="indent" >  “No, sorry. All I know is that they are pissed at us for some reason and they have
been yanked home.”
</p><!--l. 19100--><p class="indent" >  “Fine.”

mess up my project.”
</p><!--l. 19107--><p class="indent" >  She receives a trace smile, which immediately fades to a blank look.
</p><!--l. 19109--><p class="indent" >  “So, let&#x2019;s see.” He looks down at his mobile screen and reads, “Sara Veye-beak
Stennsrudd.”
</p><!--l. 19112--><p class="indent" >  She smiles with the anatomy of a duck.

</p><!--l. 19122--><p class="indent" >  “Why the hell are they using the Norwegians for this? Aren&#x2019;t there any US allies we
could be working with?”
</p><!--l. 19125--><p class="indent" >  The virtual presence of Republican senator MacMillan seems strangely immobile
for its level of agitation; the reality of the image is not entirely convincing, sitting at
this long conference table. Den is sitting near to the bottom of the table. He bides his
time. There is no hurry to speak up here. There are plenty of others here talking:
government aids, consortium members and external guests from a variety of religious
organizations.
</p><!--l. 19133--><p class="indent" >  “Aren&#x2019;t they allies?” someone asks.
</p><!--l. 19135--><p class="indent" >  “They produce oil, therefore they cannot be an ally.”
</p><!--l. 19137--><p class="indent" >  “Great Britain is an ally. Don&#x2019;t they produce oil?”
</p><!--l. 19139--><p class="indent" >  “The hell with Great Britain. They do what we tell them.”
</p><!--l. 19141--><p class="indent" >  Den smiles in the privacy of his own cave. The older senator has apparently not
mastered the idea of a virtual meeting. Sitting there in Washington, he really thinks he
is surrounded by Americans. That, or he simply doesn&#x2019;t care who he oﬀends. The
marionettes in this gloriﬁed phone-conference are well rendered human ﬁgures, but
they do not necessarily look like the people who are operating their strings.
Players experience a low threshold for oﬀending pieces of artwork, with only
simulated facial expressions. Still, one wonders what this man is like face to
face.
</p><!--l. 19151--><p class="indent" >  “The Norwegians are the least of our troubles. They are safe, sir,” says an apparent
aid.
</p><!--l. 19154--><p class="indent" >  “Apparently, Reverend Weinberg likes spending his holidays there, Senator,” one of
his aids supplements. “Norway and the U.S. apparently share a common blessing: a
Christian South. A Bible belt. He tells me that it is a country where we actually have
great inﬂuence, through the right channels.”
</p><!--l. 19160--><p class="indent" >  “No kidding?” The senator&#x2019;s gruﬀness takes pause for a second of thought. “What
do you make of this, Tony?”

</p><!--l. 19163--><p class="indent" >  “Well it&#x2019;s just a country, but politically it is not a bad decision. Norway is always
wanting to be in on the action. They never try to lead the way, or try to get the upper
hand. It&#x2019;s just always there, trying to compromise, trying to get involved. I like that.
Stay in the shadows; make no enemies.”
</p><!--l. 19169--><p class="indent" >  “But do they have experience of the kind of technology we are looking
at?”
</p><!--l. 19171--><p class="indent" >  “We hire only the best. It&#x2019;s a high tech country, Sam.”
</p><!--l. 19173--><p class="indent" >  “No kidding?”
</p><!--l. 19175--><p class="indent" >  “That is my estimation.”
</p><!--l. 19177--><p class="indent" >  “Well good. I guess it&#x2019;s nothing to worry about. Good. But doesn&#x2019;t this add
an extra level of complication to our strategy? Do you think we can cope
with it? Could we make contact with the Christian base directly – to help us
somehow?”
</p><!--l. 19182--><p class="indent" >  “It might be possible, but strictly speaking that&#x2019;s not our problem. That is why we
have secured ourselves Mr. Morris&#x2019;s services. We intend to use our contacts in the
evangelical churches to apply pressure where we can. I&#x2019;m in touch with the embassy
on that – but that is a side issue here.”
</p><!--l. 19188--><p class="indent" >  “This is the man Dean picked up?”
</p><!--l. 19190--><p class="indent" >  “Morris? Yes, sir. Here is here with us at the meeting.”
</p><!--l. 19192--><p class="indent" >  Den allows his avatar, his VR likeness, to raise a hand in silence. As an image
designer, he likes these virtual meetings. The great advantage of an intermediary
reality is that one can simulate the little ﬁnesses of human social contact, like the
raising of a hand to speak, or seeing all of the members of the meeting in a bird&#x2019;s-eye
view. It is less intimidating than having a bunch of cameras pointing at all of the
members&#x2019; faces, and then trying to watch nine diﬀerent views at the same
time and butt in at the right moment. Technology has its beneﬁts. He has
chosen his image here carefully; it does not resemble his actual physical
appearance, but rather that of an older man, more portly and staid than he
is. He has not met anyone here. Senator Dean has not yet shown up at the
meeting.
</p><!--l. 19205--><p class="indent" >  “Hello, Mr. Morris.”
</p><!--l. 19207--><p class="indent" >  “Hello.”
</p><!--l. 19209--><p class="indent" >  “Where is Dean, anyway?”
</p><!--l. 19211--><p class="indent" >  “He&#x2019;s supposed to be joining us, sir. I guess he&#x2019;s been delayed.”
</p><!--l. 19213--><p class="indent" >  “Fine, all right. Why don&#x2019;t we get started, before we all go nuts. What are we all
doing here? What&#x2019;s the agenda. Jerry?”
</p><!--l. 19216--><p class="indent" >  “Thank you, sir. Welcome everyone to this virtual meeting. I&#x2019;ll be presenting to you
in a moment our plan for rapid action, but for the beneﬁt of the group, let me just run
though the names. You should be seeing them on your displays now.” He pauses only
slightly. “Now, as you all know, our special interest here is to bring the morality of the
church back into the fore of leadership in this country. The greatness of our
spiritual institutions has been diluted over the years by the sinners in politics,
who would have it that there is no place for a moral content to government.

The American people disagrees with this, but so-called liberals have long
held the reins of media and they have polluted the airwaves with all kinds of
decrepitude.”
</p><!--l. 19228--><p class="indent" >  Assent of: “Hear, hear!”
</p><!--l. 19230--><p class="indent" >  So, Den thinks, you sly bastards. We are working for the church, after all.
Somehow, he is not surprised. A cloud of doubt and suspicion condenses in his mind
from the vapours of the past week. Once again, his eﬀorts to take charge of his future
lead him merely into greater servitude.
</p><!--l. 19235--><p class="indent" >  “As you know, our strategy has been to supplant the traditional media outlets
with a single, more powerful array of options. We are already succeeding
in attracting people away from the traditional media – although we have
been unable to do this without the help of Hollywood and certain technology
interests.
</p><!--l. 19241--><p class="indent" >  “We seem to have to have that situation under control, but we are still lagging
behind on the transfer of focus to our position of authority. The traditional media are
mostly in bed with the government, and we need to shift attention from them over to
the church&#x2019;s machine.”
</p><!--l. 19247--><p class="indent" >  “Jerry, I think we are all familiar. . .”
</p><!--l. 19249--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I . . . all right. Let&#x2019;s move on.”
</p><!--l. 19251--><p class="indent" >  He pauses, perhaps out of disappointment, or perhaps to call on new powers.
</p><!--l. 19253--><p class="indent" >  “I am here to inform everyone about our planned up-coming R.A.O.”
</p><!--l. 19255--><p class="indent" >  “What&#x2019;s that?” Den asks.
</p><!--l. 19257--><p class="indent" >  “Our Rapid Action Operation. This has come upon us more quickly than
anticipated. Our intelligence services have been planning this for some time, but
recent revelations . . .” He makes inverted commas with his ﬁngers. “. . .necessitate a
small change in the schedule.”
</p><!--l. 19262--><p class="indent" >  He throws up a diagram on the presentation wall of the meeting room
and each attendee gets a smaller copy in front of them, closer to their visual
ﬁeld.
</p><!--l. 19266--><p class="indent" >  “This is a map of the game plan for drawing support to the congregations. We have
an opportunity to cement the power base of the country in the evangelical churches
more permanently than before, while the civil government and its arms are quite
weak.”
</p><!--l. 19271--><p class="indent" >  A British voice pipes up: “Why do you say that the forces of civil government
are weak?” Den identiﬁes the man as a member of the British civil service,
McEnzie—presumably with delegated powers of government. He speaks with that
insuﬀerable poshness, which belies Britain&#x2019;s continued predilection for private
schools that groom for government.
</p><!--l. 19278--><p class="indent" >  “Because we now have a window.”
</p><!--l. 19280--><p class="indent" >  “Explain it, Jerry.”
</p><!--l. 19282--><p class="indent" >  “Here it is. Civil government is currently stretched by the rise in lawlessness. By
the lack of moral values in society – the very noose which they have made for
themselves, you might say. The riots and gangland crime is keeping them busy. The

forces in the U.S. are particularly over-stretched and the Japanese are apparently
seeing the same kind of thing. We have a window of opportunity to move on our
agenda because of recent revelations about the gaming software, as you are all aware.
So far we have had to move carefully. The F.B.I. has been watching us, at the behest
of our more secular colleagues. These who oppose our motion, claim to stand for the
federal will. But, we are not disheartened. The revelations about the game have now
unleashed a number of attacks by the mob on the computing industry. The F.B.I.&#x2019;s
hands are pretty much full trying to quell these attempts to move in on the
game.”
</p><!--l. 19297--><p class="indent" >  “Why didn&#x2019;t we think of that sooner?”
</p><!--l. 19299--><p class="indent" >  “What the hell does the mob want with the game?” someone asks.
</p><!--l. 19301--><p class="indent" >  “Yes. They&#x2019;re crooks, not politicians?”
</p><!--l. 19303--><p class="indent" >  Den smiles, alone in his cave, wondering if there is a distinction. Politics is a
dangerous sport, he thinks. You spend time ﬁghting one another instead of ﬁghting the
true enemies of the world.
</p><!--l. 19307--><p class="indent" >  “Well, that&#x2019;s a bit simplistic. The mob are looking for opportunities, just like
everyone else.”
</p><!--l. 19310--><p class="indent" >  “Quite,” says the English voice. “These days, who is to distinguish between one
group from the next? Strikes me that we are dealing with cliques and mobs wherever
you look.”
</p><!--l. 19314--><p class="indent" >  “Isn&#x2019;t that why we are here? To bring all these people back into the ﬂock?”
</p><!--l. 19317--><p class="indent" >  “But the maﬁa? Gang violence? That&#x2019;s an underground operation. Why would they
want to get involved in media?”
</p><!--l. 19320--><p class="indent" >  “Simple. Identity theft. Extortion. If you control the game, you can trick people out
of their private information and assume their identities. If you can do that, then
you have access to all of their resources. Information is power, ladies and
gentlemen.”
</p><!--l. 19325--><p class="indent" >  “Jesus Christ. It just gets worse.”
</p><!--l. 19327--><p class="indent" >  “Sir, please moderate your blasphemy.”
</p><!--l. 19329--><p class="indent" >  “Pardon me, Mr. Pournelle.”
</p><!--l. 19331--><p class="indent" >  “We have to be aware of all of these things. People are in competition over this. Our
campaign is going to have to work on a number of levels.”
</p><!--l. 19335--><p class="indent" >  “Well, we have a head-start. We have been planning our campaign for some time.
And it&#x2019;s a campaign with many facets. Not just a simple operation.”
</p><!--l. 19339--><p class="indent" >  “Indeed. The campaign has been building up for some time, but never openly. What
we are suggesting now is a more concerted eﬀort, a strong push that will capture a
large congregation in one fell swoop. It&#x2019;s an opportunity that we have to
grasp.”
</p><!--l. 19344--><p class="indent" >  The bong of a gong sounds in Den&#x2019;s head. A overlaid text shows a new arrival at the
meeting. The table adjusts its length and Senator Dean materializes.
</p><!--l. 19348--><p class="indent" >  “Welcome, Senator Dean,” says the aid apparent.
</p><!--l. 19350--><p class="indent" >  “Hello, everyone. Mr. Morris. Sorry I&#x2019;m a little late. I had some business with my
youngest. Somehow they never quite leave the fold. What did I miss?”

</p><!--l. 19354--><p class="indent" >  MacMillan says, “We just started, but the timing is good. Mr. Morris. . .” He turns
his attention down the non-existent table, sending packets of information to and fro&#x2019;
beneath the Atlantic ocean, in tightly conﬁned ﬁbres. “You have been singled out as a
key person in this operation. With your access to game information streams, we
can tap directly into the game channels without going through the oﬃcial
consortium route. We don&#x2019;t want to draw unnecessary attention to this project
amongst competing interest groups. They would probably place barriers in our
way.”
</p><!--l. 19364--><p class="indent" >  Silently observing and mulling, Den does not feel like making reply, but knows that
he should. Now is not the time to be herded like cattle by these Christian cowboys. “I
was recently asked to help, yes,” he says. “My understanding was that you wanted us
to invent a speciﬁc campaign from scratch. That will take a few days to come up with,
at least. More than that I have not learned yet. I have not been long back in the
U.K..”
</p><!--l. 19372--><p class="indent" >  “That is one reason for holding this meeting today,” Dean interposes. “Not
everyone has been introduced. Everyone participating in this net meeting will be
receiving bios and contact information to everyone else in the group.”
</p><!--l. 19377--><p class="indent" >  Den adds. “I confess that I&#x2019;m not exactly clear about what kind of campaign
you want us to instigate. It sounds as though you already have a campaign. I
was led to believe that I would be starting this from scratch, with creative
control.”
</p><!--l. 19382--><p class="indent" >  “That is not entirely true,” senator MacMillan puts. “We have a partial
campaign for the U.S., but we have larger ambitions here. The game has been put
together to be a global event. We are not just supplanting the regular media
here in the U.S., but all over the world. If we play our cards right, we can
reach out and unify the world into a single moral and spiritual entity. But our
campaign, thus far, is tied to the U.S., and I am told that it will not work
elsewhere, for whatever reason. Perhaps Claire can tell us something about
that?”
</p><!--l. 19391--><p class="indent" >  A female ﬁgure, sitting at the table, is highlighted. “Our research shows that U.S.
advertising culture is diﬀerent enough from the rest of the world that we must
employ local expertise to reach out beyond our borders. But that applies
mainly to the billboards and slogans. The core parts of the gaming can be used
universally.”
</p><!--l. 19397--><p class="indent" >  “Such as?”
</p><!--l. 19399--><p class="indent" >  “You tell us, Mr. Morris” MacMillan says. “Senator Dean seems to think that you
are the man for the job.”
</p><!--l. 19402--><p class="indent" >  “Mr. Morris and his company pretty much have their ﬁnger on the pulse and have
the keys to the game. I think you can help us, can&#x2019;t you Mr. Morris.”
</p><!--l. 19406--><p class="indent" >  Den notes that it is not a question he is presented with. He is pleased that
he chose to switch oﬀ the emotional rendering in his apparition. “I am still
checking out some legal details,” he says. “I can only discuss generalities at this
time.”

</p><!--l. 19411--><p class="indent" >  “May I remind you of the deal you made with Senator Dean, Mr. Morris. Are you
telling us that you are considering changing your position?”
</p><!--l. 19415--><p class="indent" >  “I think we made only a verbal agreement,” Den corrects. “I am an honourable
person,” Den says. “But I am also a law abiding person. I am treating this meeting is
a conﬁdential consultancy. But I have made no promise yet. I still have to
let my legal department investigate our position in helping you.” He feels
Kylie McLachlan&#x2019;s arms embrace him from behind, in his London cave,
watching and advising. It is just as well the others cannot see that she is there, he
thinks.
</p><!--l. 19424--><p class="indent" >  “Well, please ﬁnd it out quickly. the clock is now ticking and we need your help.
We can either reward you handsomely, or you are out of it.”
</p><!--l. 19427--><p class="indent" >  “And we shall hold you to your NDA, Mr. Morris.”
</p><!--l. 19429--><p class="indent" >  “Fine. What I can tell you is that we have the technology and the rendering
techniques to make a broad campaign. When I know the details, I can put together a
suggestion for both active content and passive content. I&#x2019;ll need more information,
obviously.” We also have certain ethics standards in our company, he thinks, but omits
to mention it at this juncture. They go somewhat beyond the idea of a Non-Disclosure
Agreement. “It shouldn&#x2019;t be a problem.”
</p><!--l. 19437--><p class="indent" >  The ﬁgure, referred to as Claire, continues. “I can say a little more about the general
campaign,” she drawls. “For the gaming part, we have two new point-scoring scripts:
a conspiracy mystery and a classic adventure hunt. These are popular game items,
according to our research.”
</p><!--l. 19443--><p class="indent" >  “How will these help the campaign?”
</p><!--l. 19445--><p class="indent" >  “We&#x2019;ve had morality barometers for some time now, in several parts of the game,
but we want to go even further. We&#x2019;ve been pushing to have it built into the
fundamental platform that all the gaming software uses, so even third party
contributions have it. If you don&#x2019;t behave as we want you to, you don&#x2019;t score in the
game and you lose privileges. Kids respond to that kind of thing, they are more ﬁckle,
but not adults.”
</p><!--l. 19453--><p class="indent" >  “Neat.”
</p><!--l. 19455--><p class="indent" >  “We have a separate program for coaxing kids back to patriotism.”
</p><!--l. 19457--><p class="indent" >  “Preying on kids seems a little harsh.”
</p><!--l. 19459--><p class="indent" >  “Hah. Right. Let&#x2019;s make no mistake here, these kids are already under attack from a
whole host of sources.”
</p><!--l. 19462--><p class="indent" >  “Under attack?”
</p><!--l. 19464--><p class="indent" >  “Sure. From both inside and outside the country, there are professional
recruiters, turning kids into hackers and criminals, promising them all kinds
of things for working on their behalf. Kids don&#x2019;t have a moral compass at
an early age. They just want to have a good time. They think of crime as a
game.”
</p><!--l. 19470--><p class="indent" >  “The strategy is to trace their activities over time, learn who their friends are and
then make them think that they are letting their closest friends and parents down by
not acting in their country&#x2019;s best interests.”

</p><!--l. 19474--><p class="indent" >  “Actually, it is easier to make virtual friends for many of these kids. They can&#x2019;t
usually tell the diﬀerence. A lot of them don&#x2019;t meet, except in the game.”
</p><!--l. 19478--><p class="indent" >  “So you make them a role model to your own speciﬁcations?”
</p><!--l. 19480--><p class="indent" >  “Gotta catch&#x2019;em early” Claire makes a nervous soccer-mom laughs. ”Anyways.
Our department reckons these game modules will have pretty universal appeal, and we
can put a fair bit or resources into tying in popular music and star appearances for the
kids.”
</p><!--l. 19485--><p class="indent" >  “Is this going to be enough?” MacMillan asks. “Sorry, I know that I am not an
expert here, but shouldn&#x2019;t we actually go up against the war-games and . . .you know.”
His avatar waves its hands expansively.
</p><!--l. 19489--><p class="indent" >  “Some of the treasure hunting scenes are placed in amongst the government&#x2019;s
war-games, i.e. belonging other modules. We are adding our own subliminal content
there to paint them in a black light, but we cannot get involved directly in the warring
regions ”
</p><!--l. 19494--><p class="indent" >  “Why not?”
</p><!--l. 19496--><p class="indent" >  “We have to engage players in more sedate scenarios to program their
attitudes.”
</p><!--l. 19499--><p class="indent" >  Den proﬀers an explanation. “Once the pulse is racing, once it goes above about a
hundred, and the body is secreting adrenalin, it is not receptive to higher cognitive
impulses. People don&#x2019;t listen when they are agitated. They are basically on primitive
autopilot. So we have to place these suggestions in the parts of the game where people
are thinking.”
</p><!--l. 19506--><p class="indent" >  “Exactly.”
</p><!--l. 19508--><p class="indent" >  “So you draw them away from the ﬁghting?”
</p><!--l. 19510--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s the idea.”
</p><!--l. 19512--><p class="indent" >  “And once they are away from the ﬁghting”
</p><!--l. 19514--><p class="indent" >  “Then we hit them with all kinds of impulses, live and static.”
</p><!--l. 19516--><p class="indent" >  MacMillan shakes his head, and murmurs with a certain awe. “I don&#x2019;t know. This is
all a new world, isn&#x2019;t it? Do we really have it under control?”
</p><!--l. 19520--><p class="indent" >  Claire continues: “We have noted one thousand facial expressions that stimulate the
emotional responses we want. These play a key role in representing our outreach
campaign. They engage people.”
</p><!--l. 19524--><p class="indent" >  Den interjects again: “Facial rendering is a something that we spend a lot of time
developing in diﬀerent social groups. That is one of the areas where our company has
signiﬁcant expertise. If the dynamical billboards and smart surfaces do not convey the
right expressions to the right players, you can end up simply harming your
cause.”
</p><!--l. 19530--><p class="indent" >  He feels Kylie&#x2019;s ﬁngers tug at him, telling him not to be too eager. Don&#x2019;t get carried
away, Den.
</p><!--l. 19533--><p class="indent" >  “We know that, Mr. Morris. And that is an area where we will be needing your
help.”
</p><!--l. 19536--><p class="indent" >  “We get the players to meet and compare facial expressions. And we make them
laugh, at least once every session. Laughter helps you to unwind. It counter-acts stress

and builds a bond of trust. The governmental games are about winning – greed, value
and aggression – scoring points at other peoples&#x2019; expense. We are saying: when you
play with us, you will be happy and healthy.”
</p><!--l. 19543--><p class="indent" >  “Laughter is a resonance phenomenon. If you laugh, the whole world laughs with
you.”
</p><!--l. 19546--><p class="indent" >  “So they say.”
</p><!--l. 19548--><p class="indent" >  “The billboards are central here too—in the games, but our campaign is more than
that. The government&#x2019;s message is multi-faceted. On the one hand, it is essentially
trying to keep the populace open to the idea of military interventions around the
world. Our form of governance is peaceful. We want to spread a calming inﬂuence
around the game, not an agitation. On the other hand, they want to makes themselves
in the image of a strong authoritative leadership.”
</p><!--l. 19556--><p class="indent" >  Den purses his lips, inside the VR balaclava. These religious groups might not want
to promote war, but they do want to have absolute control by essentially rendering
everyone passive and be accepting of the guidance they receive from their leaders.
Who was it that said democracy comes in waves? The tide seems to have been going
out on this kind of social order.
</p><!--l. 19563--><p class="indent" >  The Reverend speaks. “The president has always been a strong ﬁgure. We do that
well in the United States. One man speaking with a clear voice, like the pope or like
my own shows. Be a lighthouse, be a beacon, and people will follow. They want to be
told the Truth. The Way.”
</p><!--l. 19568--><p class="indent" >  “And we are going to tell them, Reverend.”
</p><!--l. 19570--><p class="indent" >  The man who introduced the meeting glows somewhat impatiently in his meeting
apparition. “Can we get back to the logistics of this operation? I know you all have
limited time, and I certainly do.”
</p><!--l. 19574--><p class="indent" >  “All right,” Dean says. “Tell us.”
</p><!--l. 19576--><p class="indent" >  A southern voice: “Ain&#x2019;t it real easy? We ingress the procedure, real quick.
Do our business and egress the hell out before they know what it was hit
&#x2019;em!”
</p><!--l. 19580--><p class="indent" >  “We can expect resistance from the F.B.I.”
</p><!--l. 19582--><p class="indent" >  “From Interpol.”
</p><!--l. 19584--><p class="indent" >  “This is not a military operation, sir.” The British voice stirs. “If one is savvy in the
approach, and chooses the moment accordingly, the more they try to stop it, the faster
it is likely to succeed. It&#x2019;s just like quicksand—an unfortunate childhood fantasy of
mine.”
</p><!--l. 19589--><p class="indent" >  “We can start pretty much straight away, here in the U.S., and that is the plan. But
we have one small problem that is delaying us. . .”
</p><!--l. 19592--><p class="indent" >  “Problem? Don&#x2019;t we want solutions?”
</p><!--l. 19594--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, sir. If they are forthcoming.”
</p><!--l. 19596--><p class="indent" >  “Then solve the problem.” A laugh of arrogance. A military laugh.
</p><!--l. 19598--><p class="indent" >  “Well, the problem might actually work to our advantage too.”
</p><!--l. 19600--><p class="indent" >  “Now you&#x2019;re talking. So what&#x2019;s the problem?”

</p><!--l. 19602--><p class="indent" >  The man&#x2019;s virtual rendition moves to the head of the table and ﬂips a ﬂip-chart to
reveal a new colour image.
</p><!--l. 19605--><p class="indent" >  “This is a billboard that has been placed in the game. As you can see, it is not what
we designed.”
</p><!--l. 19608--><p class="indent" >  The image is detailed in compositional layers, with images and subliminal text
shown clearly. Errors have crept into the rendition, however. Den recognizes the
pattern from his investigations, and from what Cathy Kim told him.
</p><!--l. 19613--><p class="indent" >  “We are apparently experiencing some technical problems. I understand that these
will be solved soon? At least if these Norwegians are as smart as they claim to
be.”
</p><!--l. 19617--><p class="indent" >  “Asia.”
</p><!--l. 19619--><p class="indent" >  “What?”
</p><!--l. 19621--><p class="indent" >  “I think the work is done mostly in Asia.”
</p><!--l. 19623--><p class="indent" >  The senator sighs. “It just gets worse. Don&#x2019;t we do anything ourselves anymore?
How the hell did that happen?”
</p><!--l. 19626--><p class="indent" >  “Globalization has a certain momentum. We kinda started it. . .”
</p><!--l. 19628--><p class="indent" >  “Can we get back to the point, please?”
</p><!--l. 19630--><p class="indent" >  “What are you suggesting?”
</p><!--l. 19632--><p class="indent" >  “I am suggesting that this problem with the billboards can work to our
advantage.”
</p><!--l. 19635--><p class="indent" >  “How so?”
</p><!--l. 19637--><p class="indent" >  “We can get our people to provide a solution and sending it to these companies
through the consortium infra-structure. We already have people who work in these
groups. That will allow us to control these billboards even more to our advantage than
ever before. As long as interpol is busy ﬁghting oﬀ this maﬁa threat, they will not
have the resources to notice and make a fuss about it. They probably will not even
know about it.”
</p><!--l. 19645--><p class="indent" >  “We could compound the distraction.”
</p><!--l. 19647--><p class="indent" >  “Are you suggesting that we help the maﬁa?”
</p><!--l. 19649--><p class="indent" >  “Well, we don&#x2019;t have to explicitly help <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">them</span>, just supplement what they are going.
Cause a distraction.”
</p><!--l. 19652--><p class="indent" >  “It would help us to move along.”
</p><!--l. 19654--><p class="indent" >  “It could work.”
</p><!--l. 19656--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t know as I&#x2019;m all that comfortable with that idea.”
</p><!--l. 19658--><p class="indent" >  “Is it ethical?”
</p><!--l. 19660--><p class="indent" >  “Ethics is a relative matter, let&#x2019;s not second guess. . .”
</p><!--l. 19662--><p class="indent" >  “I think it&#x2019;s just ﬁne.”
</p><!--l. 19664--><p class="indent" >  “Gentlemen. Lady. The Lord will be our shepherd.”
</p><!--l. 19666--><p class="indent" >  The words cut a silence. They take pause, apparently looking at each other around
the non-existent table. As the packets of data swim, to and fro, across the Atlantic,
Den wonders if serene crustacean life is aware of what is brewing in the hairline
optical ﬁbres that crisscross their domain. Would it raise the temperature of the
Atlantic seaﬂoor just a little?

</p><!--l. 19673--><p class="indent" >  The rendered faces of their puppet-masters look oddly dead on the avatar
apparitions, leaving the meeting to speculate on the meaning of its silence.
</p><!--l. 19677--><p class="indent" >  Finally, Dean speaks. “We&#x2019;ll get through this,” he says. “And the country will be
better oﬀ for it.”
</p><!--l. 19680--><p class="indent" >  It is followed by grunts and murmurs and more ponderous inertia. Then, in the
noise of disarray, a single clear voice speaks with leadership and breaks them out of
indecision.
</p><!--l. 19684--><p class="indent" >  “So, here is the timetable for this R.A.O..”

<!--l. 19692--><p class="indent" >  Billboards, billboards everywhere.
</p><!--l. 19694--><p class="indent" >  Broken billboards. Who should care?
</p><!--l. 19696--><p class="indent" >  There it is: the whole list, and Mary keeps coming back with more of them.
</p><!--l. 19698--><p class="indent" >  The puzzle remains. He knows of no explanation, and no solution to the
phenomenon and he has not received any information back from the game consortium
about his own reports.
</p><!--l. 19702--><p class="indent" >  Den Morris emerges from the elevator almost into the arms of his new
assistant.
</p><!--l. 19705--><p class="indent" >  “Ah Mr. Morris,” he says.
</p><!--l. 19707--><p class="indent" >  “Den,” says Den. “Call me Den.”
</p><!--l. 19709--><p class="indent" >  “Sorry. I am ready anytime you want to start.”
</p><!--l. 19711--><p class="indent" >  “&#x2019;Okay.&#x2019;
</p><!--l. 19713--><p class="indent" >  A passing Henderson interrupts. “Dennis. You stole my intern.”
</p><!--l. 19715--><p class="indent" >  Den winks at him and keeps on walking.
</p><!--l. 19717--><p class="indent" >  “Mr. Morris. There has been a call for you.”
</p><!--l. 19719--><p class="indent" >  Ah yes, he diverted his calls to the help desk. Nice save. Den shrugs and walks past
Henderson again.
</p><!--l. 19722--><p class="indent" >  “Who was it?”
</p><!--l. 19724--><p class="indent" >  “A Mrs. Waites.”
</p><!--l. 19726--><p class="indent" >  “Mrs. Waites?”
</p><!--l. 19728--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s what she said.”
</p><!--l. 19730--><p class="indent" >  What on Earth? “What did she sound like? Old, young? British, American?”
</p><!--l. 19732--><p class="indent" >  “American woman. Middle aged, I don&#x2019;t know.”
</p><!--l. 19734--><p class="indent" >  “Damn.”
</p><!--l. 19736--><p class="indent" >  “Anything wrong?” Raj asks.
</p><!--l. 19738--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t know.”
</p><!--l. 19740--><p class="indent" >  He was not expecting to hear from her.
</p><!--l. 19742--><p class="indent" >  “Thanks. I&#x2019;ll deal with it.”
</p><!--l. 19744--><p class="indent" >  “So, I&#x2019;m ready, Mr. . . Den.”

</p><!--l. 19746--><p class="indent" >  Den nods positively. “Well done, that man! A little later. Keep up the good
work. Oh. . .” He lowers his voice slightly. “Would you mind asking Kylie
McLaughlin to come in? And I don&#x2019;t want us to be disturbed for the next
hour.”
</p><!--l. 19751--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, Mr. . .I mean, Den.”
</p>
<div class="center"

<!--l. 19753--><p class="noindent" >
</p><!--l. 19754--><p class="noindent" >*</p></div>
<!--l. 19757--><p class="indent" >  Kylie McLachlan has removed her jacket and is perched on the edge of his desk.
She is looking stunning as always, but Den can see that she has had a busy day and
that her patience is on the thin side. Den places the oﬃce in private-meeting
mode.
</p><!--l. 19762--><p class="indent" >  “So, I looked at the sequences they sent you. Some would ﬁnd them a little strange
to say the least.”
</p><!--l. 19766--><p class="indent" >  “I know.” He pauses, recapping in his head. “I had Raj start tracing the
precedents, following the standard model, just to see what had been done before
in this area. It actually seems to have begun after the Iraqi invasion in the
early 2000s, after the two-towers incident in New York. An elderly American
politician started a television campaign naming Europe as America&#x2019;s next
great threat to American national security, because the French and German
governments would not cooperate in legitimizing the Anglo-American invasion
force.”
</p><!--l. 19776--><p class="indent" >  He ﬂips through some of the images.
</p><!--l. 19778--><p class="indent" >  “But Europe? The enemy? Who are they kidding?”
</p><!--l. 19780--><p class="indent" >  “He did seem serious.”
</p><!--l. 19782--><p class="indent" >  “No doubt.” Kylie McLachlan shakes her head subtly as she reads the
auto-transcript.
</p><!--l. 19784--><p class="indent" >  “These broadcasts were sent on American television sometime in 2003, I
think.”
</p><!--l. 19787--><p class="indent" >  “Well, aside from the fact that this sounds like the rantings of a James Bond
world-domination psychopath, nothing much would surprise me anymore
about the American right wing. These are people with more money than
sense.”
</p><!--l. 19791--><p class="indent" >  “It makes me a bit uncertain. Do you think we can use any of this? What is it telling
you?”
</p><!--l. 19794--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m not sure what it&#x2019;s telling me, but it seems clear that you cannot use anything
like this in our campaign?”
</p><!--l. 19796--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s pretty morbid.”
</p><!--l. 19798--><p class="indent" >  “Didn&#x2019;t you say there was a British member in the group? Doesn&#x2019;t he have anything
to say about this?”

</p><!--l. 19800--><p class="indent" >  Den shrugs. “He seemed to be along for the ride. Perhaps he isn&#x2019;t privy to all the
info.”
</p><!--l. 19803--><p class="indent" >  Kylie rolls her eyes. “Oh come on, Den! It&#x2019;s supposed to be a battle for hearts and
minds, not for spreading hate and inciting enemies.”
</p><!--l. 19806--><p class="indent" >  “Well, you know the old dictum: when you have them by the balls, hearts and
minds will follow.”
</p><!--l. 19809--><p class="indent" >  “Dennis Morris, wash out your mouth this instant! Don&#x2019;t repeat that shite in front
of me after a bad day. It&#x2019;s just not funny.” She articulates the words with a
school-mistress sarcasm. The Scottish accent nails it.
</p><!--l. 19813--><p class="indent" >  “Right.”
</p><!--l. 19815--><p class="indent" >  “But this is not the Christian lobby surely? It doesn&#x2019;t seem their style?”
</p><!--l. 19817--><p class="indent" >  “This comes more from hard liners, who want to be seen as Christian, but they are
not directly connected to the church. They might be working together. After all, there
is no more holy a war than a Holy War.” He shrugs at her scowl. “From what we have
seen, there are those who simply want to keep people ﬁghting in the game, to keep
them open to the use of violence to solve America&#x2019;s political problems. These people
come partly from the N.R.A. and partly from the government. Then there are
the Christians who basically want to wrest power from the law and place it
back in the hands of the church. They have won a number of victories over
constitutional law in recent years and now they seem to be mounting their
oﬀensive. Both parties oﬀering us a lot of money to help them out with our expert
services.”
</p><!--l. 19831--><p class="indent" >  “You&#x2019;re not seriously thinking of going along with this?”
</p><!--l. 19833--><p class="indent" >  Den stops; he can imagine a video scenario where a respected senator delivers a
message to the American people, and an angel comes down and touches him. He
would probably burst into ﬂames, but it is a chilling premonition.
</p><!--l. 19837--><p class="indent" >  “I still haven&#x2019;t said yes to them.”
</p><!--l. 19839--><p class="indent" >  “I should think not.”
</p><!--l. 19841--><p class="indent" >  Den looks down sullenly. “You know, I thought this could really be our big chance.
Our opportunity to make money and become famous.”
</p><!--l. 19844--><p class="indent" >  “Are you not already famous, Dennis Morris?” she invokes the school-mistress
again. “Did you not just stand in front of a thousand people and talk about your
successes?”
</p><!--l. 19848--><p class="indent" >  He shrugs and nods reluctantly. “But this is an additional contract that could mean
millions for the company. And I&#x2019;m sort of worried that if we don&#x2019;t agree, they&#x2019;ll ﬁnd a
way to cut us out of the work we are already doing.”
</p><!--l. 19852--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s a risk. But at least you&#x2019;d have the law on your side.”
</p><!--l. 19854--><p class="indent" >  He nods. “That still leaves us with the question of what to do. Being idealistic
doesn&#x2019;t solve the conundrum.”
</p><!--l. 19857--><p class="indent" >  She sits down behind his desk and swivels in his chair. “I know this was important
to you, Denny,” she says more softly. “But why could you not play with the nice boys
on the block?”
</p><!--l. 19861--><p class="indent" >  “Maybe it&#x2019;s not as bad as we think.”

</p><!--l. 19863--><p class="indent" >  “Maybe.” She nods. “We can hope so. Otherwise I&#x2019;m not sure the human race is
going to have all that many brownie points at the pearly gates.”
</p><!--l. 19866--><p class="indent" >  Den looks up, at her. Focus, he thinks. Don&#x2019;t wallow. Outlook. Intellect before
dejection. Discipline.
</p><!--l. 19869--><p class="indent" >  “So why do you think they are so keen on this new campaign now? What has really
changed?”
</p><!--l. 19872--><p class="indent" >  Kylie stirs from her posture and inhales a deep breath. “Fear has taken over the
wheel of politics,” she philosophises, “especially in the U.S., but also the world over.
Fear mongering has been too successful for its own good.”
</p><!--l. 19877--><p class="indent" >  “Fear of what though?”
</p><!--l. 19879--><p class="indent" >  “Freedom, or loss of freedom. The Western way of life.”
</p><!--l. 19881--><p class="indent" >  “Come on. . .”
</p><!--l. 19883--><p class="indent" >  ”Come on! Everything we hear these days is telling us that the West is going to
have to sacriﬁce its position of privilege, to make way for better human rights in other
countries, and allow the developing world to have a larger share of the cake. They
must be terriﬁed.”
</p><!--l. 19889--><p class="indent" >  “And somewhere like China actually has the power to do it. . .”
</p><!--l. 19891--><p class="indent" >  “And then they have a succession of presidents who drone on about truth and
freedom around the world, at the same time as they are dictating the terms of that
freedom. American citizens are probably asking themselves: are <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">we </span>really living in a
free society?” She aﬀects a silly voice: “The government says that America is the
Land of the Free, which means we feel like we ought to be able to do what we like.
But the government is pretty big on telling people what they should do. How do you
resolve that?”
</p><!--l. 19902--><p class="indent" >  “Do you think people are malcontent?”
</p><!--l. 19904--><p class="indent" >  “The conﬂict is ﬁnally being noticed, and it seemed to be coming to a
head. The NRA and libertarians have been lobbying for that for years, right?
But it&#x2019;s really just propaganda and people are realising it now. America has
been one of the most tightly authoritarian societies since its inception, at
least in its attitudes. If it&#x2019;s citizens ever got real freedom, it might all just fall
apart.”
</p><!--l. 19911--><p class="indent" >  “What is freedom anyway?”
</p><!--l. 19913--><p class="indent" >  “Now there&#x2019;s the real debate.”
</p><!--l. 19915--><p class="indent" >  “So the propaganda message is backﬁring.”
</p><!--l. 19917--><p class="indent" >  “Well, that&#x2019;s my guess. This strong focus on liberty and freedom has persuaded
people that they should have it themselves. Never mind the middle East, or North
Korea. What about right there at home in the U.S.? It&#x2019;s a provocation.”
</p><!--l. 19922--><p class="indent" >  “Well, sometimes you need someone to shake people out of their rut to get them
moving? Otherwise the will quietly subsist in pleasant servitude.”
</p><!--l. 19925--><p class="indent" >  “Like the Nazis did? So, what, you need a prophet: a Hitler or a Jesus
Christ?”
</p><!--l. 19927--><p class="indent" >  “Ronald Raygun or George Nucular Freedom?”
</p><!--l. 19929--><p class="indent" >  “You took the words right out of my gob, Dennis Morris!”

only that that he is worthless from an early age. The only way that he can redeem his

can, with all that singin&#x2019; and lovin&#x2019; and fallin&#x2019; and pushin&#x2019;—and me-oh-my what else

</p><!--l. 20007--><p class="indent" >  “Well, if that&#x2019;s your answer. . .” She springs up from the chair. ”Before you do, let
me show you something.”
</p><!--l. 20010--><p class="indent" >  Den stares at her for a while and stretches out a hand. She takes it and she
about-turns and pulls him through a doorway at the rear of his oﬃce. It conceals a
small room where there is a small VR test-cave, not much bigger than a street
lavatory, and a couch for resting. She brushes past him in and moves past the couch
and into the cubicle. There is no one here.
</p><!--l. 20017--><p class="indent" >  “Is this where you work?”
</p><!--l. 20019--><p class="indent" >  “Only when I want some peace and quiet.”

a simple scenery program.
</p><!--l. 20024--><p class="indent" >  She has cleverly managed to manipulate him, willingly into a position where they
are close and facing one another. He touches her arm and she swoons towards him
with a sly smile.
</p><!--l. 20028--><p class="indent" >  “Hello,” she says.
</p><!--l. 20030--><p class="indent" >  Den grins and pulls her towards him, holding her nose just in front of his. She
smells sweetly with a tutti-frutti kind of perfume. She is breathing heavily now and
staring at his face, too close to see him.

from the waking dream. Kuala Lumpur can be cool and refreshing in the early hours,
as the sun is reaching above the horizon. She was trying to imagine herself lying in a

not been aware of. Drifting on an ocean is not just simple and safe. The ocean was
polluted.
</p><!--l. 20298--><p class="indent" >  She sat in front of her combo station, altar and guardian, mixing work with

</p><!--l. 20322--><p class="indent" >  It seemed to her like a fairy tale, like a dream. It was the start of an exchange, a
relationship that would carry her across the planet. A sequence of conversations, like
acts in a play. Suspense and dramatic development evolving from innocence to
conscious deﬁance. Like a classic fable in which a magical apparition tasks its hero
complete riddles and tests before it will grant its magic. A classic challenge-response
dialogue.
</p><!--l. 20330--><p class="indent" >  So she began.
</p><!--l. 20332--><p class="indent" >  On the ﬁrst day, she asked her question.

contention from non-authorized sources?”
</p><!--l. 20337--><p class="indent" >  The help-desk could not answer immediately. The question became a task, an
impossible task of sifting through impenetrable documentation and calling
programming teams; it was like emptying a lake with a wooden spoon, or
ﬁnding a diamond in a mountain of salt — but, eventually, they found her
answer.
</p><!--l. 20343--><p class="indent" >  Her question had been an unusual one, and the analysis, which had led her to it, was

interesting to the help-desk staﬀ. They told her that they were impressed and that they
would add her experience to their own. Self-taught Preeta felt pleased with
herself.
</p><!--l. 20348--><p class="indent" >  She was smart.
</p><!--l. 20350--><p class="indent" >  She was valuable.
</p><!--l. 20352--><p class="indent" >  Employee of the month.
</p><!--l. 20354--><p class="indent" >  On the second day, it became apparent that the problem was not solved. She needed
help once again. Billboards and scenery were intermingling and security procedures
were failing.
</p><!--l. 20358--><p class="indent" >  She dispensed with the VR interface for the most part, and relied on text. She
joined the queue once again. This time, however, the person at the other end was not

me.”
</p><!--l. 20368--><p class="indent" >  At ﬁrst she was confused and uncertain. But the fairy helped her as far as he or she
could.
</p><!--l. 20371--><p class="indent" >  “Thank you, you have been a lot of help,” she told it.
</p><!--l. 20373--><p class="indent" >  It sighed and repeated its dilemma. Preeta empathized. “If you help me, then maybe
I can help you,” she suggested.
</p><!--l. 20376--><p class="indent" >  “No, no. This is not your problem. It&#x2019;s a diﬀerent part of the game, that has to do
with rules and laws and weak and strong. It would need a brave warrior and access to
the full game information feed.”
</p><!--l. 20380--><p class="indent" >  “I have access to the full feed,” she told the fairy.
</p><!--l. 20382--><p class="indent" >  “Really? No. . .”
</p><!--l. 20384--><p class="indent" >  On the third day, some time later, the ticket handler had spent hours helping her ﬁnd
out what she needed.
</p><!--l. 20387--><p class="indent" >  “So how is going getting your contract ﬁlled?”
</p><!--l. 20389--><p class="indent" >  There is a long pause. “I shouldn&#x2019;t talk about it. You might get into trouble.”
</p><!--l. 20391--><p class="indent" >  “Why?”
</p><!--l. 20393--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s a touchy political area.”
</p><!--l. 20395--><p class="indent" >  “But you had to ﬁnd someone. You could lose your job?”
</p><!--l. 20397--><p class="indent" >  “All true.”
</p><!--l. 20399--><p class="indent" >  Over the next few nights, they chatted in a friendly way. Sometimes they would
game, or battle in the Hai Noon Karate lounge, to relieve the stress. It was like having
a pen-pal. Preeta had never known anyone from the U.S., not like this. They grew to
be game-buddies.
</p><!--l. 20404--><p class="indent" >  In time she oﬀered again. “I can help you. You have helped me.”
</p><!--l. 20407--><p class="indent" >  “I would like that,” said the voice, no longer a help-desk fairy, but a friend.
</p><!--l. 20409--><p class="indent" >  “Well, T13, you are the lucky winner in my draw.”
</p><!--l. 20411--><p class="indent" >  Her help-desk ticket number was thirteen.

</p><!--l. 20413--><p class="indent" >  “You&#x2019;re the winning entry. You can work on this development, but you must
promise not to tell your company. You will be paid a little by untraceable money
transfer.”
</p><!--l. 20416--><p class="indent" >  A prickling thrill ran through her body
</p><!--l. 20418--><p class="indent" >  “Do I actually get paid?”
</p><!--l. 20420--><p class="indent" >  “Not exactly well, but if the work succeeds I can get you a promotion.”
</p><!--l. 20422--><p class="indent" >  “Like a job in the U.S.?”
</p><!--l. 20424--><p class="indent" >  “(Laughs). Why would you want that?”
</p><!--l. 20426--><p class="indent" >  “Never mind.”
</p><!--l. 20428--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t. Perhaps your wish will come true.”
</p><!--l. 20430--><p class="indent" >  “So what is the job?”
</p><!--l. 20432--><p class="indent" >  “Something to help monitor and search information ﬂows in the game. It is very
important. We&#x2019;ll tell you how it must work.”
</p><!--l. 20435--><p class="indent" >  So, each night, her friend would reveal to her a single piece of the puzzle,
laying out the jigsaw of a grand design in front of her, almost as if testing her,
tasking her to make the leap, to take the job. She knew that it was wrong to talk
about her work with anyone, even the help-desk staﬀ, but he would feed her
morsels of information about the greater plan, building her trust, so she had to
reciprocate.
</p><!--l. 20442--><p class="indent" >  The Russians say: trust but verify.
</p><!--l. 20445--><p class="indent" >  She did not verify.
</p><!--l. 20447--><p class="indent" >  She trusted.
</p><!--l. 20450--><p class="indent" >  As the weeks went on, she spent more time on the project. She learned more about
it. It was to be a tool to help law enforcement organizations trace the roots of
exploitation and smuggling through the VR. Children and women lured into
prostitution. She could see the value of a tool to protect innocents. She could certainly
sympathize with its motivation.
</p><!--l. 20457--><p class="indent" >  The commercial slogans that she was employed by PlasmaScape to program into
the game were not messages of freedom and joy, not of release and recreation, but of
control and subjugation. Preeta has had enough of that in her life.
</p><!--l. 20462--><p class="indent" >  So she became more and more aware of her own dilemma. The fairy cum friend had
opened her eyes and woken her on her raft. Her ocean was a dirty place: bath water
that was full of noxious poisons, thinly masked with sweet fragrances. Could she
honestly earn her future freedom by working for a company whose basic agenda was
so contrary to what she believed was right?
</p><!--l. 20469--><p class="indent" >  Preeta returned to her books during those weeks. She was used to studying by
herself, so she studied and studied. She studied as she used to. There was unknown
mathematics in the idea, not something that just anyone could implement. She had to
read and learn and test out the ideas for herself.
</p><!--l. 20475--><p class="indent" >  She had an advantage over others who might have taken on the contract. She has
access to the game&#x2019;s inner workings, in a way that few others had. She was not afraid
to exploit that advantage.

</p><!--l. 20479--><p class="indent" >  After a month, she knew that the program could be coded and the problem could be
solved. She delivered a simple test, a mock-up, and he told her: “Your work is
impeccable.”
</p><!--l. 20484--><p class="indent" >  But by now she was neglecting her real work, and it was starting to show. Cracks
were forming in Mota&#x2019;s patience. His tone was increasingly like that of her father and
it called into play all of her old guilt, all of her uncertainties.
</p><!--l. 20489--><p class="indent" >  Was she going to give up again? Did she have no real backbone? Wasn&#x2019;t
everything that had ever happened to her really just her own fault – ﬁctitious
problems of her own making? Why had she not simply accepted the lot she
had been given, married according to her family&#x2019;s wishes and done as she
was told? Everything would then have been so calm, so peaceful? Wouldn&#x2019;t
it?
</p><!--l. 20496--><p class="indent" >  Instead, all she ever did was to run away. That meant starting over again: it was her
comeuppance, or her reward.
</p><!--l. 20499--><p class="indent" >  Stability and calm. Was that what it is like in the West? Peaceful obedience?
Everyone doing what they are told in a nice orderly fashion? There, in the East,
nothing stands so still. The stability she knew was of a diﬀerent kind: an inﬁnite
choppy sea, the constancy of a hurricane, of relentless, adaptive change, forever
breaking up and moving things around like a school of ﬁsh, or a swarm of
insects.
</p><!--l. 20507--><p class="indent" >  This too is a kind of stability; there is predictability in it, and hence certain
knowledge. But it is a more honest kind of stability than the pretence of polished
obedience. Isn&#x2019;t that true?
</p><!--l. 20511--><p class="indent" >  Now she was caught slacking oﬀ on one promise that she had made to Mota, her
impromptu saviour, and she was embarking on a diﬀerent promise. She was adapting
to the chaos of the world. She felt that that was what an honest person should do.
What is the sense of maintaining traditions and old agreement that have outlived their
validity?
</p><!--l. 20518--><p class="indent" >  So before she knew it, she was involved in a subterfuge and there was no turning
back. She was running away from authority once again. And once again, she had no
idea what she was running into. But that is the nature of the cycle. The endless loop of
tape.
</p><!--l. 20523--><p class="indent" >  Sirens wailed, on and on, during those long nights.

<!--l. 20530--><p class="indent" >  She has been playing with their tools for tracing connections. Bishop gives her
credit for this work, but this is really something that she has been working on for some
time, back in Malaysia.
</p><!--l. 20534--><p class="indent" >  She put the thing together, but the ideas have been trickling in for some time from

her contacts in the VR. She assumed that these people were working for the game, but
who knows who anyone really is these days?
</p><!--l. 20538--><p class="indent" >  It&#x2019;s not like you can reach out and take a DNA sample from someone in the VR.
That is not even going to work in the real world much longer.
</p><!--l. 20541--><p class="indent" >  Her contact told her to keep it secret, so she did. It was mainly for fun,
but she ﬁgured that one day it would give her a bargaining advantage that
might save her from a future of sweat-house programming. So far, it has paid
oﬀ.
</p><!--l. 20546--><p class="indent" >  “I am scared of the Russian maﬁa,” she tells Jonathan.
</p><!--l. 20548--><p class="indent" >  “Of course you are. That&#x2019;s the whole idea. Everyone is scared of the maﬁa. that&#x2019;s
what they do.”

Romania.”
</p><!--l. 20554--><p class="indent" >  “Has something happened?”
</p><!--l. 20556--><p class="indent" >  “The signals all point to the fact that an operation is mounting. It has been
building up for some time. They are making contacts at all points in our graph.
They have hit several of our central players. Do you think we should raise the
alarm?”
</p><!--l. 20561--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s interesting.”
</p><!--l. 20563--><p class="indent" >  “No: this is interesting. Look, there is a retarded correlation between the
game consortium activity plan, the Christian response and this gang-land
stuﬀ.”
</p><!--l. 20567--><p class="indent" >  “Correlation doesn&#x2019;t mean much, does it?”
</p><!--l. 20569--><p class="indent" >  “It means they are moving together.”
</p><!--l. 20571--><p class="indent" >  “But there is something else this software shows up – there is another centre that is
growing in size. It&#x2019;s starting to compete naturally with the return to organized
religion.”
</p><!--l. 20575--><p class="indent" >  “What is it?”
</p><!--l. 20577--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t know. Something educational, but there are also references to biochemistry.
All I know is that there are ties to a large company that has holdings somewhere in
Spain and the United States. The name Vascon keeps coming up. I don&#x2019;t know what it
means yet.”
</p><!--l. 20582--><p class="indent" >  “Vascon.”
</p><!--l. 20584--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t know what it means.”
</p><!--l. 20586--><p class="indent" >  “Hard to tell without more info.”
</p><!--l. 20588--><p class="indent" >  “I found something else too.”
</p><!--l. 20590--><p class="indent" >  “What?”
</p><!--l. 20592--><p class="indent" >  “Your group here has a collaborative research project with Vascon.”
</p><!--l. 20594--><p class="indent" >  An eyebrow is raised.
</p><!--l. 20596--><p class="indent" >  “When I was in Malaysia, I was asked to do some work like this. Exactly like
it.”
</p><!--l. 20599--><p class="indent" >  “What does that mean?”

</p><!--l. 20601--><p class="indent" >  “This is closed information. You have special access to it from this location, with
police IDs. That means that whoever contacted me ﬁrst. . .”
</p><!--l. 20604--><p class="indent" >  “So is there anything else?”
</p><!--l. 20606--><p class="indent" >  She nods. “Look at this.”
</p><!--l. 20608--><p class="indent" >  She calls forth a broad visualization that she has been preparing during sleepless
nights. She has made it as convincing as she possible can. This will be her ﬁrst test. If
she can convince Jonathan, she could convince Bishop?
</p><!--l. 20613--><p class="indent" >  His eyes seem to sharpen and intensify as he scans the image. This tool is new to
him, but he knows his stuﬀ.
</p><!--l. 20616--><p class="indent" >  There it is: the whole picture, not necessarily in perfect clarity — there is some
interference, maybe even the colours are false, but nevertheless the devil is there in the
details.
</p><!--l. 20620--><p class="indent" >  It is a war. A silent war. What else is warfare, if not politically motivated conﬂicts
of interest? They have been waiting for the moment and now the technology is here.
The tank and the ﬂying bomb might have furnished the old regimes with the tools they
needed for their campaigns; now information technology has furnished the world&#x2019;s
greatest persuaders with their own atomic bomb. They have in their hands
something just as eﬀective, just as elemental as the nuclear chain reaction:
information.
</p><!--l. 20629--><p class="indent" >  This is a struggle for the certain existence of religion itself, she realizes. A battle
not merely for survival but for domination. Coexistence is no longer enough,
perhaps.
</p><!--l. 20633--><p class="indent" >  In the present global confusion, they have seen their moment, their opportunity to
bring a kind of order. It has all come full circle – from the time when men were
individual savages, having to ﬁght for their comfort, to the present time of the selﬁsh
mobile communicator, no longer able to forge proper relationships. Religion will
bring you together, relieve you of your loneliness.
</p><!--l. 20640--><p class="indent" >  But perhaps it is not a circle. It must be a spiral. The world has moved on; people
are more sophisticated. It is really a kind of ecological warfare. The computer, her
program, sees all these connections. Politics is an ecology of ideas. It amounts to the
same thing.
</p><!--l. 20646--><p class="indent" >  And her role in all of this? She, young, naive, on the inside of someone
else&#x2019;s ﬁght, a reactionary. They have used her to get access to the one part
of the information they did not already see. For all their cooperation, the
police forces of the world have few powers. The needed a mole, they got
her.
</p><!--l. 20652--><p class="indent" >  Jonathan eyes her disturbingly as he studies the screen, as if weighing
up the facts inside him. She can see that he understands the implications.
Bishop knows some of it, maybe all of it? Does he know that she knows,
what she knows? Could Bishop and his cronies know all about what she
did? Were they involved in orchestrating her work? She can see that it is
all a little too much for him. She has been preparing to see this for a long
time.

</p><!--l. 20660--><p class="indent" >  “So what do we do?”
</p><!--l. 20662--><p class="indent" >  Will he help her? Whose side is she supposed to be on?
</p><!--l. 20664--><p class="indent" >  He stirs from his transﬁxation and inspires a long breath.
</p><!--l. 20666--><p class="indent" >  “Did you ever tell me about how you came into contact with our group?”
</p><!--l. 20668--><p class="indent" >  She tells him part of the story. “I thought I was being moved to a safe-haven. All
this stuﬀ about maﬁa. . .maybe it is all. . .”
</p><!--l. 20671--><p class="indent" >  “If someone needed access to the deepest reaches of the game, and did not have it
by legal channels, how would we do it?”
</p><!--l. 20674--><p class="indent" >  She stares back, limiting the rising fury, the feeling of betrayal. Has she simply
been manipulated all along?
</p><!--l. 20677--><p class="indent" >  The refuge in this remote place, the lock on her apartment door, suddenly do not
seem very strong. She is no longer running from the tiger, but perhaps she is riding on
its back?
</p><!--l. 20681--><p class="indent" >  She needs to see Bishop, but he has already left.
</p><!--l. 20683--><p class="indent" >  Maybe it&#x2019;s time to make peace with Dermot.

</p><!--l. 20691--><p class="indent" >  Jonas stands in the meeting room of the hotel and admires the view. He feels
somehow poised at the edge of an abyss, as he stands on the ﬁrm ground at the
window of steel and glass. The view of the world is upside down: blazing up in
heaven, and hell has frozen over.
</p><!--l. 20696--><p class="indent" >  A fog of powdered asphalt and water vapour billows in the inverted thermals of the
Oslo basin, a balance in paradox. From his vantage point, on the top ﬂoor, Oslo&#x2019;s
patchy fog looks like a mattress, ripped open in search of hidden treasure. Some
would claim that it is. Above the carnage there is a rhapsody in blue, a realm of clean
spirits and sunny calm. It feels good to have risen above the plunder to this calm
afterlife—but, for how long?
</p><!--l. 20705--><p class="indent" >  He feels lost, as though his purpose in life has suddenly been wrenched from
him. So much working hard, he thinks, caught up in the moment, unaware
of anyone else, simply focused on the task ahead of you. Then suddenly it
stops, and you feel totally empty—detached from reality. Suddenly all you
can see is everyone else. It&#x2019;s as if the rest of the world lives on, going on
about its business, and you have died and become a ghost, who can merely
watch.
</p><!--l. 20713--><p class="indent" >  He feels irrelevant now. What can he do?
</p><!--l. 20715--><p class="indent" >  By taking on his position at the council he thought it would make things simpler.
After all, what academic wants to do his job? Only fools who live only for their own
power and status are interested in such jobs. He thought that he could simplify the
procedures, make better judgements. Instead, he has simply entangled himself
deeper in a web of nonsense and self-inﬂicted torture. These days, he has the
distinct impression that he was promoted mainly to get him out of the way.
All Jonas ever wanted was a peaceful, productive life, to ﬁnd peace with
himself.
</p><!--l. 20725--><p class="indent" >  Getting mixed up in other peoples&#x2019; worlds and problems was the last thing on his
mind. Then Kaja trapped him. First with Martin, then with guilt. One little mistake of

misplaced trust. Now every movement he makes, to wriggle out of his predicament
and save himself, he seems only to sink deeper into the quicksand. What a
mess.
</p><!--l. 20731--><p class="indent" >  Joe has delivered them to a hotel in the Holmenkollen, just outside the centre of
town, up on the hill that looks down into the city. It will soon be ﬁlled with
people for the annual Social Science Seminar. This ought to be a safe place to
keep Martin for now. Certainly he seems happy running around the corridors,
playing around the tables and chairs in the lounge and staring into its huge
ﬁreplace.
</p><!--l. 20739--><p class="indent" >  Jonas is uncertain about how he should feel about what is happening, assuming that
he actually comprehends it at all. Half of his mind is bristling with anger at being
railroaded by the ministry; the other half is ﬂoundering to understand what kind of
mess the world is in, when a would-be scientist and his student are harassed by
mobsters over a petty misunderstanding. No one seems to know if they are really in
danger or not.
</p><!--l. 20747--><p class="indent" >  There is no point in ﬁghting the bureaucrats, or at least so he believes. They don&#x2019;t
even talk the same language, as far as he knows. And he cannot ﬁght the mob, since
he doesn&#x2019;t even know who they are.
</p><!--l. 20751--><p class="indent" >  How did I get here?
</p><!--l. 20753--><p class="indent" >  “Jonas, good to see you here bright and early.”
</p><!--l. 20755--><p class="indent" >  Jahn Braathen, a former colleague who turned from statistical physics to social
sciences.
</p><!--l. 20758--><p class="indent" >  “Hello, Jahn.” They shake hands. “Good to see you again.”
</p><!--l. 20760--><p class="indent" >  “How are things at the University?”
</p><!--l. 20762--><p class="indent" >  He shrugs. “So so. As always, a little too much to do. How are things at the
research council?”
</p><!--l. 20765--><p class="indent" >  Jonas grins. “Paradise on Earth.”
</p><!--l. 20767--><p class="indent" >  They laugh and chat about work for a while. Braathen tells him that he was recently
made Professor.
</p><!--l. 20770--><p class="indent" >  “That must mean a lot to you.”
</p><!--l. 20772--><p class="indent" >  He shakes his head in despair. “It&#x2019;s not like it used to be, you know. I mainly spend
my time handling applications for research time from my own colleagues now. It&#x2019;s a
little more money, but it doesn&#x2019;t mean much.”
</p><!--l. 20776--><p class="indent" >  Jonas already knows this. It is another reason to be mad at the ministries of
government. You cannot argue with a mule.
</p><!--l. 20779--><p class="indent" >  “But greater autonomy, no?”
</p><!--l. 20781--><p class="indent" >  He nods, but Jonas can see that it is a mixed blessing. He has spoken with enough
professors to know that the dreams of aspiring to professorship, to do world-breaking
science are far from the current truth. The regulating bodies who try to sculpt the
country&#x2019;s creativity have arranged for so many ‘quality control&#x2019; duties to perform that
there is little hope of being creative anymore. And one cannot argue with them. They
do not even share the same deﬁnitions. To them, a professor is an accredited unit of
expertise. A professor knows everything. Once a clay mannikin is animated with the

power of professorship, it becomes a symbol of ultimate authority: a passport or
token of wealth in the academic system that enables groups of academics the
freedom to decide for themselves what they can do. Like wielding the power
of Excalibur. Without it, they are slaves to the decisions of parliamentary
functionaries.
</p><!--l. 20797--><p class="indent" >  To Jonas, to an academic, a professor is just a colleague who got lucky and did
some good work. It is certainly not someone with special a moral right to license
activities that other academics are disallowed. But how does one explain such
a distinction to a bureaucrat? It&#x2019;s like telling a camel that a whale is not a
ﬁsh.

the hotel.
</p><!--l. 20813--><p class="indent" >  People are gathering in the lobby of the conference centre. Jonas has been walking
with Martin. He sees that Kaja has tried to call him this morning, but he cannot face
speaking with her now.
</p><!--l. 20817--><p class="indent" >  The sessions will be starting in a few minutes, and people are milling around in
ones and twos. He could try to take Martin with him to the sessions, but that might be
a little too much even for him. Besides, he is not at premium inspiration level for
scientiﬁc debate this morning. Other concerns have intruded.
</p><!--l. 20823--><p class="indent" >  He stand here and wait for Joe, contemplating the city from top of the hill. Joe has
promised to come back and take Martin while Jonas tries to make some sense of what
is going on around him. He needs to go back to the city; he needs to make some kind
of transition arrangement to protect the hundreds of groups who have been expecting
funds that will now be diverted due to government intervention. They have not
given him much time to act, and he is damned if he is going to let friends and
colleagues be submitted in this roughshod trampling without some kind of
armour.
</p><!--l. 20832--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Come on, Joe. Where are you?</span>
</p><!--l. 20834--><p class="indent" >  People are lining up for their coﬀee now, eyeing one another uncertainly and
exchanging platitudes. Conferences can be depressing displays of personal ineptitude,
he thinks. Academics who gather and talk after each presentation, ranting on about the
subject of the talk, never really changing the subject, because they don&#x2019;t know how to
talk about anything else. Later, they drift apart, embarrassed because this is the
only form of social intercourse they can muster. Later still, they sit around at
the conference banquet, eating by themselves and pretending not to look
uncomfortable, if they cannot ﬁnd a group in which they can repeat the same all over
again.

</p><!--l. 20846--><p class="indent" >  A geeky looking woman walks past expostulating on the plight of the poor. He
snatches other slices of conversation as they move in and out of earshot.
</p><!--l. 20850--><p class="indent" >  “Religious rites are a form of control that I found unacceptable from an
early age: The singing, the praying, the suppression of genuine emotion for
brainwashed tranquillity.” She shudders. “What is the real diﬀerence between
religion and the military? Ask no questions, soldier! You are what I tell you to
be!”
</p><!--l. 20856--><p class="indent" >  “These are the important questions. That and ‘why is Octoberfest in September?”&#x2019;
</p><!--l. 20859--><p class="indent" >  “Humans are not interfering with evolution, they are not going against nature. That
is a belief which comes from an essentially religious dogma: belief in a deity
who sets laws. Humans <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">are </span>nature. We are a product of it, everything we do,
everything we build is a product of evolution. It is the evolution of ideas which
came from the physical evolution of a mind. It just means that evolution
has found a way to spread into software. It is the same process and we are
surviving because we have developed communication and sharing in social
systems, just as cells found they could cooperate biologically. There is no
diﬀerence.”
</p><!--l. 20870--><p class="indent" >  “Tell that to the churches.”
</p><!--l. 20872--><p class="indent" >  “There wouldn&#x2019;t be any point. They have already shot themselves in the foot as far
as understanding goes. If you deﬁne what is right and wrong and never question your
assumptions, then you are doomed to live the lie.”
</p><!--l. 20877--><p class="indent" >  These meetings are the only form of social intercourse many of them have. It
probably hurts. He wonders if these people have sex. One supposes that people can
always manage that, of course, but with tenderness? Is it all just biting and grabbing?
Hot clay dummies pumping each other? Suddenly his academic colleagues seem
distant from his own reality.
</p><!--l. 20884--><p class="indent" >  Half an hour passes before Joe arrives.
</p><!--l. 20886--><p class="indent" >  “I have all the contacts, and I can let Martin join one of my groups and keep an eye
on him. Are you sure you want to go through with this, Jonas?”
</p><!--l. 20890--><p class="indent" >  Jonas nods. “Yes, quite sure. I have too much to do to be stopped by threats that I
don&#x2019;t even know anything about.”
</p><!--l. 20893--><p class="indent" >  “And Martin is okay with this?”
</p><!--l. 20895--><p class="indent" >  His eyes trace Martin, close by, playing amongst the people in the room. “Are
you kidding? This is the best adventure he&#x2019;s had in a long time. He likes
you.”
</p><!--l. 20899--><p class="indent" >  As if to prove the point, he comes, practically running towards them to
greet Joe. Joe lifts him up and fusses over him in a cool and collected kind of
way.
</p><!--l. 20903--><p class="indent" >  “I have to go and sort out this mess that is brewing—and I want to ﬁnd out what
Kaja is up to.”
</p><!--l. 20906--><p class="indent" >  “Is that a good idea?”
</p><!--l. 20908--><p class="indent" >  “Probably not, but I&#x2019;m going to do it anyway.”
</p><!--l. 20910--><p class="indent" >  “You know what you should do?”

</p><!--l. 20912--><p class="indent" >  “Tell me please.”
</p><!--l. 20914--><p class="indent" >  “I have a contact through Get Smart. She is kind of the global coordinator for
projects like mine around the world. There is a similar initiative in Europe called Save
Our Schools. SOS.”

might be able to help you.”
</p><!--l. 20928--><p class="indent" >  “I didn&#x2019;t know such things still existed. But, what could she possibly do?
I don&#x2019;t think a philanthropist is in a position to help us. It&#x2019;s gone beyond
that.”
</p><!--l. 20932--><p class="indent" >  “Give it a chance. She has a lot of contacts and she is an big inspiration to
me.”
</p><!--l. 20935--><p class="indent" >  “Joe, I hate to say it, but this interference in government policy probably comes
directly from the Church.”
</p><!--l. 20938--><p class="indent" >  He nods. “I know. The writing is on the wall.”
</p><!--l. 20940--><p class="indent" >  “Doesn&#x2019;t it ever worry you what you are mixed up in?” he says, half jokingly and
half in frustrated accusation.
</p><!--l. 20943--><p class="indent" >  “I think you should talk to her. You would be surprised what she can do. I
think she is used to dealing with far more diﬃcult situations than this. In fact,
maybe I should get her to contact you. If my project is one of those that is
going to lose out in this change in policy, then she is going to be interested in
that.”
</p><!--l. 20949--><p class="indent" >  He examines Joe&#x2019;s intense eyes. He seems excited about the possibility and Jonas
feels a glimmer of hope in his dark mulling, as if he has been aﬀorded a glimpse of
blue heaven above the fog of mortal plunder.
</p><!--l. 20953--><p class="indent" >  “Your work is impressive, Joe. you should be proud of what you are doing for
kids.”
</p><!--l. 20956--><p class="indent" >  “Schools only teach kids to be machine parts, not adaptive people. Not many kids
manage to become anything more. Right now, we&#x2019;re setting them all up for
future redundancy. A cheap, no-frills, disposable workforce. It&#x2019;s a moral
issue.”
</p><!--l. 20961--><p class="indent" >  Jonas feels his mobile vibrating. He looks at the caller ID and his heart
sinks.
</p><!--l. 20964--><p class="indent" >  “This could be it. Excuse me.”
</p><!--l. 20966--><p class="indent" >  “Mr. Lindgren, I am going to send you the address of a location where you can
leave a message for me. I would like your cooperation quickly and with a minimum of
fuss. I think that you are going to change your mind.”
</p><!--l. 20971--><p class="indent" >  Is it a joke?
</p><!--l. 20973--><p class="indent" >  “I can&#x2019;t leave a message. I need to meet you.”
</p><!--l. 20975--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t play games, Professor.”

</p><!--l. 20977--><p class="indent" >  He ought to keep the line open long enough for the police to perform their trace.
After a brief pause, a signal indicates that the trace is done.
</p><!--l. 20981--><p class="indent" >  “Please leave us alone,” he says simply and kills the connection.
</p><!--l. 20983--><p class="indent" >  Martin whispers. “Daddy, are we going to get shot?”

<!--l. 20991--><p class="indent" >  Jonas has never been able to leave Oslo. Something holds him here. Perhaps it is a
kind of fear, a clinging on to familiarity. Perhaps that was also his reason for
remaining with Kaja for so long too: not so much a need as a cowardice. It seemed
convincing for a while, at least until the beauty of their union was cracked open by
vulgar revelations.
</p><!--l. 20998--><p class="indent" >  He told her about his hope and his dreams, and the very things that made him
weak. Words spilled out of him at that moment. He gave her a weapon at that
moment, a weapon that she could use against him. Later, he hoped that she
would not have the presence of mind to use it, but they both know that she
could. It is their unspoken truce, a basic decency in all their ﬁghting, a line
they have never crossed. It has to mean that they still have feelings for one
another.
</p><!--l. 21006--><p class="indent" >  Jonas looks at his growing list of messages on his mobile. Some unknown . . .
a surprise – Bjørn, an old friend, brings a smile . . . and Kaja. He nods to
himself and scans the list, comparing the names. It is strange how the sight of a
name that once elevated him to the heights of joy now ﬁlls him with dark
apprehension.
</p><!--l. 21012--><p class="indent" >  The last of the messages is from the Oslo District Police, marked urgent.
</p><!--l. 21014--><p class="indent" >  “We have intercepted the call, and have intelligence on a plausible trace. Please
drive from your current location to the map location shown below in 30 minutes.
Leave your mobile on open channel. You will be safe.”
</p><!--l. 21018--><p class="indent" >  He leaves Martin with Joe and takes a rental car. What is all this? As he drives
down the winding road from the hotel, a call comes in.
</p><!--l. 21021--><p class="indent" >  “Dr Lindgren, this is detective Khan from the Oslo District Police. We have traced
your caller to an activist group, based just outside of Oslo. We do not believe that they
are related to the maﬁa, but they could still be a threat to your safety. We are
deploying resources to clear this up quickly. Please follow the instructions I sent and
this should be over soon.”
</p><!--l. 21028--><p class="indent" >  He agrees to the request, uncertain of what to think, but seeing no alternative. At
least the action by the police has been swift and helpful. They could have treated him
as a madman. Perhaps this is more common than he imagines.
</p><!--l. 21033--><p class="indent" >  The little electric loan-a-car hardly feels like a safe haven to Jonas, but he drives
along the route as they have requested, following the smaller roads into the city,

parallel to the ring-road, his mind oscillating between his current situation and the
growing mess at work. He lends more than passing seriousness to the question of
which of his tormenters is the most serious.
</p><!--l. 21040--><p class="indent" >  There is little traﬃc at this time of day here, but he is in no hurry to arrive at the
Vindern location on his map. The post-autumnal trees fail to oﬀer their normal cover,
but he has descended back into the clouds and the world has become grey once again,
embalmed and mortiﬁed by the inverted cloud-cover. He feels both trapped and
exposed.
</p><!--l. 21047--><p class="indent" >  The lightest rain begins to fall on the windshield, making visibility more diﬃcult
through the semi-fog. He begins to have his mobile read him his messages to pass the
time.
</p><!--l. 21051--><p class="indent" >  Message one: suggesting getting together for dinner one day, from his old friend. A
past life comes to remind him that it is still living on in some other reality. Then three
messages from Kaja, in various states of mind. She tells him ﬁrst what a jerk he is,
then she apologizes and says she loves him. Then she says please come home with
Martin. It will take him some feat of planning to break the news of these past days to
her. Then, at the end of it, he must throw himself into another boiling pot at the
council.
</p><!--l. 21060--><p class="indent" >  He slows to navigate a roundabout, wishing that there were some other vehicles on
this route to keep him safe. The police have equipped his phone with their own
software, but his spectres could easily be tracing his movements, for all he knows.
With the right software, it does not take long to ﬁnd someone once they have started to
transmit.
</p><!--l. 21066--><p class="indent" >  Without warning, an old red Volvo pulls out of nowhere and overtakes him at
high speed. It brakes sharply in front of him, forcing him to brake in tandem.
The harsh red light of its brakes are blinding. He curses the fool, grasping
the steering wheel tightly, before realizing the potential signiﬁcance of the
lights.
</p><!--l. 21072--><p class="indent" >  Is this it? Is this them?
</p><!--l. 21074--><p class="indent" >  As his heart kicks into gear, he fumbles to place the car in reverse. Two ﬁgures get
out of the of the Volvo and walk swiftly back towards him. He expects them to be
masked, but if they are the masks look like human faces.
</p><!--l. 21079--><p class="indent" >  As he selects reverse and turns his head to steer behind him, the white lights of a
second car pull up behind him, blocking the way. He is ambushed.
</p><!--l. 21083--><p class="indent" >  As rational thought surfaces amoment, he hits the panic button on his mobile and
locks the doors of the rental. Two more men get of the car behind and walk to his
side.
</p><!--l. 21087--><p class="indent" >  “Mr. Lindgren. I am detective Hansen, please step out of the car.”
</p><!--l. 21089--><p class="indent" >  He shows an image of a ID card on a small tablet. Jonas checks his own mobile to
see if any ID has been received. Nothing. Could they be plain-clothes oﬃcers? If so,
why so many? Why would they stop him like this?
</p><!--l. 21093--><p class="indent" >  “Send me the signed ID,” he shouts back through the closed window.
</p><!--l. 21095--><p class="indent" >  “Get out of the car, you must come with us.”

</p><!--l. 21097--><p class="indent" >  Jonas sits tight, his stomach and heart ﬁghting inside his mid-regions.
</p><!--l. 21099--><p class="indent" >  “Who are you?”
</p><!--l. 21101--><p class="indent" >  “Please, Mr. Lindgren. Don&#x2019;t make this diﬃcult. We require your expertise. We are
asking you to cooperate for the good of the country.”
</p><!--l. 21104--><p class="indent" >  “Send me your ID so I can verify it.”
</p><!--l. 21106--><p class="indent" >  The four men appear to be Scandinavian. There is no one here whom he could tie to
the accent that spoke to him on the phone. Of course, such things can be faked. They
look at one another and nod.
</p><!--l. 21110--><p class="indent" >  One of the them pulls out some electronic equipment and walks to the front of the
car and opens the cover.
</p><!--l. 21113--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">They are going to trigger the lock! Is that possible?</span>
</p><!--l. 21115--><p class="indent" >  He looks down at him mobile. It is ﬂashing red, indicating that the panic button has
been pressed. The men must know this, whoever they are.
</p><!--l. 21118--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Come on, come on!</span>
</p><!--l. 21120--><p class="indent" >  The police are supposed to be keeping a close eye on him, and here they have sent
him along some remote back-road far away from any regular patrols, with no one else
to help out. Are they insane?
</p><!--l. 21124--><p class="indent" >  Why don&#x2019;t they break the windows? It would be quicker, wouldn&#x2019;t it? Apparently
not. He sees the car&#x2019;s electronics die instantly and the locks open for accident
safety. If he had switched the controls into park-mode, he would have delayed
them.
</p><!--l. 21129--><p class="indent" >  Suddenly there is heavy a thud followed by another thud and everything goes
dark. He is still conscious, but the car seems to be encased in something: a
dark web has struck and covered the four men outside. The web seems to be
thick and sticky. He has never seen anything like it before, but he can guess
what it is. They seem immobilized within it. It can glued them to the car,
and has covered their arms and legs with a viscous treacle of web that has
immobilized them in a just a second. It has also glued them to him, and he is trapped
inside.
</p><!--l. 21141--><p class="indent" >  Throughout the thick, black lattice-work of the web, he sees the ﬂashing lights of
micro-copters descend and scan the scene, presumably relaying the image to a
command vehicle. They are robotic crowd-control devices which must have been
following him along his route. They have ﬁred webs from the cover of the fog.
Ingenious. So they were following him all along.
</p><!--l. 21147--><p class="indent" >  He starts to feel drowsy. They must be infused with some kind of mild tranquilizer.
The men struggle for a short while and then seem to resign themselves to their fate. Is
this it? is it over?
</p><!--l. 21151--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Now, spider, come and collect your prize.</span>
</p><!--l. 21153--><p class="indent" >  He sits there for several minutes until two police units arrive, with sirens sounding
their song, to clear up the mess. They spray the web with some kind of liquid and it
falls away, leaving them to collect the four bodies and parcel them into the back of
their van.
</p><!--l. 21158--><p class="indent" >  “Are you all right, sir?” ID says it is Khan.

</p><!--l. 21160--><p class="indent" >  He nods. “I&#x2019;m ﬁne. Who are they?”
</p><!--l. 21162--><p class="indent" >  “As far as we can tell, they belong to a vigilante activist group. Anti-something-or-other.
We&#x2019;ll ﬁnd out later. Now that we have ID, we&#x2019;ll be raiding their base of operations in
no time. With any luck that should be the end of it.”
</p><!--l. 21167--><p class="indent" >  “Not the Russian maﬁa?”
</p><!--l. 21169--><p class="indent" >  “They are a small group, posing as Eastern Europeans to frighten their
victims.”
</p><!--l. 21172--><p class="indent" >  “I see.”
</p><!--l. 21174--><p class="indent" >  “Are you all right? You should take a minute to collect yourself. Was there anyone
in the vehicle with you?”
</p><!--l. 21177--><p class="indent" >  “No.”
</p><!--l. 21179--><p class="indent" >  He walks away for a moment and directs his operations. His presumably
Pakistani colour is rendered pallid by the misty rain. He returns a moment
later.
</p><!--l. 21182--><p class="indent" >  “You&#x2019;ll be staying in town will you, sir?”
</p><!--l. 21184--><p class="indent" >  He nods.
</p><!--l. 21186--><p class="indent" >  “We might need to ask you some questions, to make our conviction. If you do leave,
make sure that you have an authentication with you so we can conduct our business by
mobile.”
</p><!--l. 21190--><p class="indent" >  He nods.
</p><!--l. 21192--><p class="indent" >  “Is there anyone you would like us to inform of today&#x2019;s operation?”
</p><!--l. 21194--><p class="indent" >  He considers registering his use of time, but in all honesty he doesn&#x2019;t care two bits
what anyone thinks.
</p><!--l. 21197--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ll be ﬁne.”
</p><!--l. 21199--><p class="indent" >  “All right, Now, let&#x2019;s see if we can move these cars, so you can get out of
here.”
</p><!--l. 21201--><p class="indent" >  “Thanks.”
</p><!--l. 21203--><p class="indent" >  Jonas walks a short distance down the road to breathe and feel the cold dampness
on his face. He dials up Joe to tell him what has happened. Joe has waited
at the hotel to have lunch. He agrees to drive down to meet him and bring
Martin.
</p><!--l. 21207--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s time to take my child back to his mother,” he tells him “I don&#x2019;t suppose you
feel like helping me with that?”
</p><!--l. 21210--><p class="indent" >  Stupid question. He cannot drag Joe into his own person crises. He has already
performed above and beyond the call of duty.
</p><!--l. 21213--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ll see you in a minute then.”
</p><!--l. 21215--><p class="indent" >  He dreads the thought of facing Kaja now. What on Earth will she say to him, and
what will he be able to say to her? This little event was over quickly. What he has to
face with her is probably for life.
</p><!--l. 21219--><p class="indent" >  Last night, while Martin slept, he told Joe all about his turbulent predicament.
Joe sat plainly and listened without comment. Then, at the end, he spoke
simply.

</p><!--l. 21223--><p class="indent" >  “None of us can have what we want from life, Jonas. The point is: can we convince
ourselves that what we can have is what we want?”

</p><!--l. 21246--><p class="indent" >  Den has a sudden, sleepy recollection of being on the ﬂight from Los Angeles and
seeing rows of factory hens.
</p><!--l. 21249--><p class="indent" >  “Hey, you. Good to see you again. How&#x2019;s things?”
</p><!--l. 21251--><p class="indent" >  The sight and sound of Cathy Kim wrench his mind back to a diﬀerent bubble of
reality: one from the recent past, ﬁlled with excitement and sensuality. It seems
misplaced here, in these London oﬃces.
</p><!--l. 21255--><p class="indent" >  “My head is still somewhere over the Atlantic,” he bemoans. “But I&#x2019;ve been
getting down to business. What&#x2019;s you situation like? I heard there was some
unrest.”
</p><!--l. 21259--><p class="indent" >  “Could be better. There&#x2019;s been rioting and looting. It&#x2019;s been hard to get into work,
but the University police have been bringing it under control again.”
</p><!--l. 21263--><p class="indent" >  “ You&#x2019;re okay?”
</p><!--l. 21265--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m good.”
</p><!--l. 21267--><p class="indent" >  “You look good.”
</p><!--l. 21269--><p class="indent" >  “Back at ya.”
</p><!--l. 21271--><p class="indent" >  “Any luck with your glitches?”
</p><!--l. 21273--><p class="indent" >  “Not really. I&#x2019;ve taken a couple of days oﬀ, visiting my mother.”
</p><!--l. 21275--><p class="indent" >  “Sounds nice.”
</p><!--l. 21277--><p class="indent" >  She laughs. “Mom&#x2019;s okay. So what&#x2019;s new?”
</p><!--l. 21279--><p class="indent" >  “Well, that&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m calling. I&#x2019;ve just had a meeting with the Senator and his
cronies.”
</p><!--l. 21282--><p class="indent" >  She whistles. “The plot thickens. What happened?”
</p><!--l. 21284--><p class="indent" >  He brings her up to date on the meeting. One group of many is planning its strategy
for dominating the information environment of world gaming.
</p><!--l. 21287--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s practically information terrorism, though they swathe it in nicer euphemisms.”
</p><!--l. 21290--><p class="indent" >  “So the Christians are ready to make their move, huh? That means they must either
have some deep contacts in the development teams, or the access systems I study can
be inﬁltrated.”

</p><!--l. 21294--><p class="indent" >  “But it&#x2019;s not just the Christian group? There are others in there, I&#x2019;m sure. I wish I
knew.”
</p><!--l. 21297--><p class="indent" >  “Or maybe you don&#x2019;t?”
</p><!--l. 21299--><p class="indent" >  “Right. I seem to be piggy in the middle.”
</p><!--l. 21301--><p class="indent" >  She nods seriously. “They know they can pull your strings.”
</p><!--l. 21303--><p class="indent" >  Den feels a stab in his ego that causes his pulse to rise. “Don&#x2019;t be so sure of that,”
he defends, “I am reviewing my options here to ﬁgure out how I can make this
worthwhile. It might be best to keep out of this particular oﬀer.”
</p><!--l. 21308--><p class="indent" >  “Be careful, Den. I&#x2019;m not sure that is really an option. You know what they say
about keeping your friends close and your enemies closer. Whatever these people are
up to, it is better to be involved somehow to keep your options open. This is taking
place at the highest level.”
</p><!--l. 21314--><p class="indent" >  “There&#x2019;s a limit to how mercenary I can be, Cath. It could damage our company if
we don&#x2019;t handle this right.”
</p><!--l. 21317--><p class="indent" >  “Then think of yourself as a double agent or something and make sure that you are
not involved in anything directly illegal. Governments are used to pouring money into
contractors who don&#x2019;t deliver.”
</p><!--l. 21321--><p class="indent" >  “Does the law even matter anymore? With everything that&#x2019;s happening. .
.”
</p><!--l. 21323--><p class="indent" >  “We have to believe that, don&#x2019;t we?”
</p><!--l. 21325--><p class="indent" >  “I think so. But our agreement? Didn&#x2019;t we agree to work our way into the winning
team?”
</p><!--l. 21328--><p class="indent" >  “We&#x2019;ll do okay without getting involved in anything improper.”
</p><!--l. 21331--><p class="indent" >  “But it means something. It means that the best way to help ourselves is to preserve
a system in which we are free to work and develop business. If we support the
Christian lobby, there is no telling how far they will regulate our industry. We don&#x2019;t
want to assist in our own destruction.”
</p><!--l. 21337--><p class="indent" >  “I agree. So that means you should not support this splinter group but still play
along and appear to give them what they want.”
</p><!--l. 21340--><p class="indent" >  Den frowns. If he gives them what they want, haven&#x2019;t they succeeded in bending
him around their little ﬁnger? What&#x2019;s the diﬀerence?
</p><!--l. 21343--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t think you are immune being in the U.K. The ripples won&#x2019;t take long to
spread. This is sensitive stuﬀ. It seems pretty comfortable from over there, but believe
me, this will aﬀect peoples&#x2019; lives.”
</p><!--l. 21347--><p class="indent" >  “Maybe we&#x2019;re taking this too seriously,” Den explores. “Is it really our duty to
ﬁgure this out? I mean, what inﬂuence can two people have anyway?”
</p><!--l. 21351--><p class="indent" >  “Den,” she says, with stark gravitas. “Once we are the centre of the network, our
inﬂuence will be <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">decisive</span>!” Her stare says: don&#x2019;t you forget that!
</p><!--l. 21355--><p class="indent" >  “If I had never gone to San Diego, I might never have worried about any of
this. I thought it was a commercial venture. Now it turns out to be a political
game.”
</p><!--l. 21359--><p class="indent" >  “Welcome to reality, cowboy. That doesn&#x2019;t mean you don&#x2019;t have to face the music.
It isn&#x2019;t going to go away just because you don&#x2019;t agree with it.”

</p><!--l. 21363--><p class="indent" >  “Reality is a pretty over-used word.” He sighs. “But you&#x2019;re right. With or without
us, it is going to happen. We might as well proﬁt from it.”
</p><!--l. 21367--><p class="indent" >  His mobile signals another incoming call. It seems like a good opportunity to end
the struggling conversation. Some of the magic of the moment has gone, he thinks. He
is outside of the reality bubble, where they met. Now her charms don&#x2019;t have the same
eﬀect, in the clarity of London.
</p><!--l. 21373--><p class="indent" >  “Look, I have to go. Another call coming in.”
</p><!--l. 21375--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah, me too. Look, stay in touch. Let me know how you get on with the Senator. I
might have something to tell you soon.”
</p><!--l. 21378--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah, you too.”
</p><!--l. 21380--><p class="indent" >  “And Den?&#x2019;
</p><!--l. 21382--><p class="indent" >  “Yes?”
</p><!--l. 21384--><p class="indent" >  Sultry satisfaction. “Thanks for a great time. While you were here.”
</p><!--l. 21387--><p class="indent" >  He smiles.
</p><!--l. 21389--><p class="indent" >  “Same to you, sunshine.”

<!--l. 21397--><p class="indent" >  Den thinks of Celia and feels a pang of guilt. She was the most important person in
his life a year ago, and now they have grown distant. The tugging in his chest tells him
that he is still ensnared by her somehow, but he also knows himself well enough to
know that any graceful female body could distract him at any time. He simply
cannot help it. However much he ought to leave it alone, he knows it is a
compulsion.
</p><!--l. 21405--><p class="indent" >  Celia was tender and beautiful. She had a special kind of grace with her older years,
unspoilt and sturdy of mind. She is a good woman, he thinks. So lonely. I&#x2019;ll call her
soon, when I&#x2019;m over this tough patch.
</p><!--l. 21411--><p class="indent" >  He has spent the last few days consolidating his position with Cathy Kim in
their eﬀorts to ﬁnd the core group of the game&#x2019;s custodians, “networking” as
she likes to call it. They have been making themselves known, marketing
themselves, as Den knows best. It is rather like the making of a celebrity, he
thinks. A little gossip here, a press release there, and lots of time talking to
people, working little charms. One should never underestimate the power of the
ju-ju. He still needs to use the VR more though. He should put Mary on the
job. Something important is obviously going down and he means to be in on
it.
</p><!--l. 21422--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s ironic, don&#x2019;t you think?” he murmured to his virtual sister.
</p><!--l. 21424--><p class="indent" >  “How so?”

</p><!--l. 21426--><p class="indent" >  “You create a game to capture the allegiance of the masses and in doing to you open
yourself up to opportunities for attack. Vulnerability is the price for reaching
out.”
</p><!--l. 21430--><p class="indent" >  She smiled at him. “The question is – is the risk an acceptable one?”
</p><!--l. 21432--><p class="indent" >  Later, the gnawing of his conscience had exposed nerves that would not calm.
Giving in to guilt, he called her to apologize for himself, but she deﬂected his apology
with one of her own.
</p><!--l. 21436--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m pathetic, aren&#x2019;t I?” she laughed.
</p><!--l. 21438--><p class="indent" >  “Celia, you are not pathetic by any deﬁnition of the word.”
</p><!--l. 21440--><p class="indent" >  “Then what am I?”
</p><!--l. 21442--><p class="indent" >  “Just a little down, that&#x2019;s all.”
</p><!--l. 21444--><p class="indent" >  “Right. And how shall I get over that?”
</p><!--l. 21446--><p class="indent" >  “We&#x2019;ll think of something,” he suggested cryptically.
</p><!--l. 21448--><p class="indent" >  She smiled at him, as if to say: you sly sonofabitch and proceeded to tell him about
the reason she called.
</p><!--l. 21451--><p class="indent" >  “I am doing you a favour here,” she said. “This is a contact that you can&#x2019;t aﬀord to
miss. She is probably going to take over the world someday, and change the way you
think.”
</p><!--l. 21455--><p class="indent" >  “Who are you talking about?”
</p><!--l. 21457--><p class="indent" >  “Connie Cortina. She&#x2019;s a friend of mine, from many dull parties. A formidable
woman – but don&#x2019;t be getting any ideas about her! What you need from her and what
she needs from you is too important to mess up by getting horny.”
</p><!--l. 21462--><p class="indent" >  “Why should I see her?”
</p><!--l. 21464--><p class="indent" >  “Because she wants to see you.”
</p><!--l. 21466--><p class="indent" >  Her voice made it clear that this was not something that he could conceivably say
no to. He saw her face light up with her old dignity when he agreed to go. Celia
simply wanted to be useful. She wanted to feel as though she made a diﬀerence to
something. When she realized that she was going to, he saw the old Celia shine
through, and resolved to contact her again soon.
</p><!--l. 21473--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Her life is not so easy, but she has so much to give.</span>
</p><!--l. 21475--><p class="indent" >  So she made the introductions for him and dates were exchanged by her secretary,
and two days later he found himself on a ﬂight to Madrid, looking forward to better
weather than that he returned to in London.
</p>

<!--l. 21479--><p class="noindent" >
</p><!--l. 21480--><p class="noindent" >*</p></div>
<!--l. 21484--><p class="indent" >  San Sebastian is not the easiest place to get to at short notice, but Celia Waites has
convinced him of the importance of this trip.
</p><!--l. 21487--><p class="indent" >  From Madrid, a shuttle ﬂight to the city, and a taxi from the airport to her home
oﬃce proved more challenging than he expected, He speaks no Spanish, and making

no certain progress with English, one must resort, with embarrassment, to the mobile
for translation.
</p><!--l. 21492--><p class="indent" >  He wonders seriously why all this fuss is necessary. All the obstacles seem to have
been placed deliberately in his way, like the hedges, moats and battlements of a
royal castle. While they give him a new respect for the power of ceremony,
as he approaches the inner sanctum, he cannot help but wonder about the
reason.
</p><!--l. 21498--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">We are a ceremonial culture in Europe</span>, he notes. He should remember that for
reference.
</p><!--l. 21501--><p class="indent" >  Catalin Constanca Alexandra Cortina seems to be a very wealthy woman. They say
that she inherited her millions from her father – a little known shipping tycoon who
managed to conceal himself from the public eye and tabloid press. Now she is an
astute business woman and treats international projects like tapas, to be nibbled at and
relished with a good wine.
</p><!--l. 21508--><p class="indent" >  She spends several months of the year in the U.S., from what he can gather,
applying her skills to business projects mainly in biotechnology. Recently, she has
moved into broader information sciences, like harvesting and advertising and, as
she has become a behind-the-scenes ﬁgurehead for globalized development,
following in her father&#x2019;s footsteps for anonymity. Lately, she has been dipping
her tapas into the game. From what he can tell, that makes her possibly the
only person in the social network who is more important than he is, at this
moment.
</p><!--l. 21518--><p class="indent" >  The VR is for meeting like this, but her secretary insisted that only a personal
meeting would be acceptable. So she is the kind of woman who needs to look you in
the eye? Or, after the ordeal of the journey, he wonders if the aim is to simply make
him jump through hoops.
</p><!--l. 21523--><p class="indent" >  Her Villa lies just outside the historical centre of the town, not by the coast, but
inland beyond the hills. As they approach the house, he sees that its grounds have
been converted into an array of out-houses, like a conference centre or even a school.
The slightly hazy sunshine, of a lifting morning mist, shines down onto youngsters,
lined up on the grassy grounds, engaged in some kind of activities that he cannot
make out.
</p><!--l. 21531--><p class="indent" >  She is not a recluse, even if she is shy of attention.
</p><!--l. 21533--><p class="indent" >  The taxi drives him through main gates and winds around through the grounds,
releasing him at the main entrance of the mansion. He nods to the driver and says:
“Gracias,” hoping that that is the right thing to say, and walks towards the impressive
entrance, noting the amount that his mobile was charged.
</p><!--l. 21539--><p class="indent" >  The house seems to live outside of time. It is clearly old, but renovated and
therefore new at the same time. The estate has converted old dwellings into functional
units that are part of whatever it is that goes on here. Den has not been able to ﬁnd out
much about the location. They appear to be both old and futuristic, even as they
display their historical legacy.
</p><!--l. 21546--><p class="indent" >  His mobile alerts him to an identiﬁcation request from the house. He transmits his

card and seconds later a slightly plump, but attractive young woman with dark curls
and a black pin-stripe suit appears at the entrance to greet him.
</p><!--l. 21551--><p class="indent" >  “Welcome, Mr. Morris,” she says, “We&#x2019;ve been expecting you. My name is
Maria.”
</p><!--l. 21553--><p class="indent" >  “Thank you,” he says. “This is an impressive estate.”
</p><!--l. 21555--><p class="indent" >  “We think so too. How was your journey?”
</p><!--l. 21557--><p class="indent" >  “Fine, thank you.”
</p><!--l. 21559--><p class="indent" >  “Good!” Her voice is sing-song, like that of someone who has not learned the
right inﬂections of a foreign language. “Are you tired? Would you like some
refreshments?”
</p><!--l. 21563--><p class="indent" >  “Thank you. Something to drink would be nice.”
</p><!--l. 21565--><p class="indent" >  “All right. Come inside and we shall arrange it. Ms Cortina has asked me to show
you the estate before your meeting. She will see you in an hour from now. I hope that
will be satisfactory.”
</p><!--l. 21569--><p class="indent" >  “Spanish hospitality,” he nods, looking around him. “Wow. Are you from
here?”
</p><!--l. 21572--><p class="indent" >  “I am Portuguese,” she says.
</p><!--l. 21574--><p class="indent" >  Utopia is not a word that Den would normally associate with this part of the world,
as much on principle as for its uncomfortable summer climate, and yet he recognizes,
in each facet of the estate, the ingredients of a grand vision, a vision of perfection. A
breath of optimism buoys the work that goes on in these buildings, and he suspects
that it is her optimism: Cortina&#x2019;s.
</p><!--l. 21581--><p class="indent" >  He is packed into a small electric buggy, whose skin adapts to the environment
rendering it translucent, and they trundle around the grounds in unobtrusive comfort,
as he is delivered into realm after realm of creative endeavour. Den was uncertain of
what to expect of the journey, and certainly of the woman. Even Celia, who has
nothing but good things to say about his host, told her little of substance about her.
Maria seems almost careful not to mention her name. She refers only to the “work we
do here”, as if they are one big happy family. Or perhaps she rules them with an iron
ﬁst.
</p><!--l. 21591--><p class="indent" >  The estate envelops an underground biotech laboratory, which apparently ﬁnances
much of the other work, a school for children from the ages of ﬁve until sixteen, then
activity centres for older children who attend local schools nearby. Why not an older
school on site? Because older children need to forge their own ideas and discover their
freedoms by breaking free of their boundaries. There is an information processing and
analysis centre and there are resources for business innovation that leaves him wide
eyed and stunned.
</p><!--l. 21600--><p class="indent" >  Den feels like a character in a Jules Verne novel, being shown Captain Nemo&#x2019;s
underwater city for the ﬁrst time. Perhaps the lady of the house is playing the
Toccata on a huge organ, even as they speak? But the ﬁlaments of optimism that
criss-cross this estate are not a ﬁctional web, they are a voluntary and spontaneous
exchange.
</p><!--l. 21606--><p class="indent" >  Everywhere they go, people look him in the eyes and talk to him. Everyone, from

the youngest children to the oldest employees. It is their policy: to communicate and
to accommodate. He sees no billboards, no advertising. It is peaceful, almost uncanny.
They have caves for game playing and access to every convenience of the modern
world, and yet they learn to abstain from these things and pursue their own ideas, from
an early age. It is one of several projects of this kind. The second was built in India,
the third in Senegal. They have an ocean liner that travels the world, spreading
their working culture as well as their sense of adventure to an international
audience.
</p><!--l. 21618--><p class="indent" >  He senses a mood of ﬁghting back, against the establishment, and yet it would
never have occurred to him that anyone could so blatantly revile the accepted mood of
the generation, and thrive along side it. He understands that the philosophy here is not
to turn its back on the present, but to turn the reclusive present around and stare it in
the face.
</p><!--l. 21624--><p class="indent" >  She introduces Den to people working in his own ﬁeld, who greet him with what
seems to be genuine enthusiasm and admiration. They know of his work and of his
status in the game milieu. He complements them generously on their facilities and
expresses his wish to be able to stay longer and talk to them longer in this little
cosmopolitan bubble.
</p><!--l. 21630--><p class="indent" >  The clanking of a clock interrupts them. The future does not halt its approach, even
in such a parallel reality. The all-too-brief tour is terminated with warm smiles and
fuss over his comfort. Maria leaves him inside the entrance to the mail building, and
returns to her station at the reception, allowing him to splash water on his amazement
and ponder his visage in a washroom mirror. He uses the dim electric light in the little
room to calm himself and adjust his cologne and demeanour. It would not be astute to
appear too impressed.
</p><!--l. 21639--><p class="indent" >  Den begins to plan his meeting, struggling to clear his mind of the many
impressions and speculations which the tour has left frothing inside him. He begins to
construct the possible scenarios in his mind. It is always preferable to take charge of a
meeting straight away, but he is not even entirely sure why he is here. He
should appear conﬁdent and calm, not too impressed, but open for a pleasant
visit.
</p><!--l. 21646--><p class="indent" >  Finally, he emerges from the washroom and Maria walks past him on her way to
another part of the building.
</p><!--l. 21649--><p class="indent" >  “Please wait in there. Tea will be served and Ms Cortina will be with you in a
moment,” she says, touching his arm as she passes.
</p><!--l. 21652--><p class="indent" >  He follows her ample behind as it recedes down a hall passage, his mind
ﬂickering brieﬂy from Celia to Cathy to Kylie, and he strolls into the room she
indicated.
</p><!--l. 21656--><p class="indent" >  She arrives ten minutes late.
</p><!--l. 21658--><p class="indent" >  Dennis Morris is greeted in a large room with a high ceiling, elaborately
ornamental; once again it makes a statement with every decoration. The walls are
adorned with classical imagery, painted in some baroque style. Varnished wood, ﬂoral
motifs and embossed arabesque haunt the details. A subtle soundscape of sea and

bird-life lingers barely on the edge of perception, taking the cold edge oﬀ the austere
furniture. If he were not certain of the dusty smell, he could imagine that he has
stumbled into a VR game room.
</p><!--l. 21667--><p class="indent" >  She enters the room from another doorway, carrying a tray of tea.
</p><!--l. 21669--><p class="indent" >  “Hola, Señor Morris. Welcome to my home.”
</p><!--l. 21671--><p class="indent" >  Her light contralto is ﬂavoured with a noticeable accent, which he ﬁnds both warm
and ceremonial, like the room. Could it be an aﬀectation, to further sculpt her image?
She approaches him fearlessly, in a light grey suit with trouser legs and a white
blouse, her brown high heeled boots clapping on the wooden parquet as she
walks.
</p><!--l. 21677--><p class="indent" >  “Thank you.”
</p><!--l. 21679--><p class="indent" >  “Have you been to the Basque region before?” She sets down the tray.
</p><!--l. 21681--><p class="indent" >  “Never.”
</p><!--l. 21683--><p class="indent" >  She is what, forty? She has a slender ﬁgure, but she is not thin, and her long
auburn hair hangs loosely around her shoulders, not even pushed behind her
ears, as if she is at peace with the idea of sharing her space with something
that lives a life of its own. She is attractive, yes, but there is a paradoxical
coldness to her warmth. It makes Den uncomfortable; he is unable to stereotype
her.
</p><!--l. 21690--><p class="indent" >  “Nice room,” he small-talks. “Is it Rococo?”
</p><!--l. 21692--><p class="indent" >  She studies his nonchalant expression, penetrating his aﬀectation. “I didn&#x2019;t know
that you were interested in periods.”
</p><!--l. 21695--><p class="indent" >  “I try,” he lies.
</p><!--l. 21697--><p class="indent" >  “Interesting. But no, we are not quite so burlesque, nor so French or Italian. It is
simply eclectic and a little epicurean.”
</p><!--l. 21700--><p class="indent" >  Out of his depth, he merely smiles and moves to shake her hand. She extends hers
as if it is to be kissed, making him falter. Damn.
</p><!--l. 21703--><p class="indent" >  “Thank you so much for coming. I very much wanted to see you,” she
says. It is a statement for the record, said neither arrogantly nor coldly. Her
tone is friendly and welcoming, but it contains a subtle command. She is a
leader.
</p><!--l. 21708--><p class="indent" >  “I know you, I have seen you before,” he says, studying her.
</p><!--l. 21710--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, in San Diego.”
</p><!--l. 21712--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, that&#x2019;s it!”
</p><!--l. 21714--><p class="indent" >  “That is where I learned about you and your work.”
</p><!--l. 21716--><p class="indent" >  So, she knows of his work. Clearly she must appreciate his importance then; but
Den still does not know what she wants. All he knows is that she is a powerful ally
and that her name seemed to put the fear of God into the senator and his colleagues
when he dropped her name.
</p><!--l. 21722--><p class="indent" >  “You were spying on me?”
</p><!--l. 21724--><p class="indent" >  “Just watching the show,” she smiles. “Did you enjoy it?”
</p><!--l. 21726--><p class="indent" >  “The meeting? Eh, yes. I would say I did.”

</p><!--l. 21728--><p class="indent" >  “And you made new contacts that will make you and your business very successful.
Quite the man of the hour.”
</p><!--l. 21731--><p class="indent" >  He nods in supposing agreement.
</p><!--l. 21733--><p class="indent" >  “The woman you were . . . associated with, you understand of course that she works
for the United States government?”
</p><!--l. 21736--><p class="indent" >  “How did you . . . Kim? What makes you say that?”
</p><!--l. 21738--><p class="indent" >  She smiles again, a comfortable smile of a woman in control of her faculties and of
his. “I know my competitors.”
</p><!--l. 21741--><p class="indent" >  She smiles at him for a moment, probing with here wide eyes, as if regarding his
demeanour.
</p><!--l. 21744--><p class="indent" >  He tries to change the subject. “Your grounds here are most impressive. I had no
idea that you were so . . . active in so many areas.”
</p><!--l. 21747--><p class="indent" >  “Thank you,” she says simply. “It is a dream of mine, all this. It means a lot to
me.”
</p><!--l. 21750--><p class="indent" >  He nods appreciatively.
</p><!--l. 21752--><p class="indent" >  “Would you like tea?”
</p><!--l. 21754--><p class="indent" >  “Thank you.”
</p><!--l. 21756--><p class="indent" >  She waves him to a small group of chairs by a window and they sit. He will not
touch the tea, no more than a sip, but it is all part of the ritual. All his powers of
concentration and projection are required here, can&#x2019;t waste his image on spilling tea or
spitting crumbs. She pours from the service and indicates the plate of English
biscuits.
</p><!--l. 21763--><p class="indent" >  He takes the cup and holds in in his hands, placing a biscuit on the saucer.
</p><!--l. 21766--><p class="indent" >  “So you are interested in education?” he gropes, trying to get down to business. “I
was not expecting to a school on the grounds.”
</p><!--l. 21769--><p class="indent" >  “Yes. Our days are numbered as personalities, don&#x2019;t you think? We need skills.
These days it is necessary for companies to invest in this area.”
</p><!--l. 21772--><p class="indent" >  Unsure of what she means, he tries: “You seem to have plenty to go around.”
</p><!--l. 21774--><p class="indent" >  She shakes her hair back and tilts her head up a little, smiling to accept the
compliment. “The world needs skills to survive, not just consumers. You cannot
maintain a society without specialists who can maintain its basic fabric.”
</p><!--l. 21779--><p class="indent" >  “Of course not.”
</p><!--l. 21781--><p class="indent" >  “Alas governments do not support education the way they should anymore, so we
have to supplement their oﬀer.”
</p><!--l. 21784--><p class="indent" >  “You are training them to work for you?”
</p><!--l. 21786--><p class="indent" >  “Not necessarily: just training them to learn how to learn.”
</p><!--l. 21788--><p class="indent" >  “I see,” he improvises, not certain of whether he believes himself.
</p><!--l. 21790--><p class="indent" >  “My idea, if you will, is that we have become too spoiled in our luxury. We have
become used to taking and using things that others create without really examining
them. We have become too passive, too accepting.”
</p><!--l. 21795--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s interesting.”
</p><!--l. 21797--><p class="indent" >  “I think so. It means that I am interested in educating people in a way that
makes them creative, not passive. Society needs such people. They are a dying

race.”
</p><!--l. 21801--><p class="indent" >  He tries to follow up, as they settle down, examining each other at close quarters,
sizing each other up.. “And then the question, I suppose, is who are these others whom
we allow to do our thinking for us?”
</p><!--l. 21805--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, indeed.” she seems pleased and sips at her tea. “Exactly. Who are they, and
will be continue to look after us?”
</p><!--l. 21808--><p class="indent" >  “It sounds like politics.”
</p><!--l. 21810--><p class="indent" >  “Perhaps.”
</p><!--l. 21812--><p class="indent" >  “So you are interested in politics?”
</p><!--l. 21814--><p class="indent" >  “Nmmm. . .” She shakes her head, withdrawing her mouth from the tea cup. “I have
always thought that politics is too full of itself. Wouldn&#x2019;t you agree? You cannot
politicize forth a world. You need people who can turn the vision into a reality:
engineers, technicians, craftsmen and women.”
</p><!--l. 21820--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s true.”
</p><!--l. 21822--><p class="indent" >  “The power of the future lies in knowledge and craftsmanship. The crafts change
from time to time, but the need does not.”
</p><!--l. 21825--><p class="indent" >  “I think you are right.”
</p><!--l. 21827--><p class="indent" >  She shrugs as if to say: of course I am.
</p><!--l. 21829--><p class="indent" >  “You must have studied. What did you study?” Den asks.
</p><!--l. 21831--><p class="indent" >  “I have a doctorate in bio-informatics. But I have studied many things since then.
And you, Señor Morris, you studied at Imperial College in London, I understand?
What was it? Econometrics and Media Analysis?”
</p><!--l. 21835--><p class="indent" >  “You&#x2019;ve done your homework.”
</p><!--l. 21837--><p class="indent" >  “It has prepared you for your job now, I suppose, but don&#x2019;t you miss the challenges
of purely intellectual achievement? Assisting others in what they do has its charms I
suppose, but do you ever miss it?”
</p><!--l. 21841--><p class="indent" >  He frowns invisibly. She has made him feel defensive, like a silly school boy. What
he needs to do is project conﬁdence, not weakness.
</p><!--l. 21844--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I miss some things about it, but I never really liked the student life. I wanted
to take more responsibility. It was more or less by chance that I got into marketing.
But I enjoy it. You might be surprised just how much analysis goes into our methods
these days.”
</p><!--l. 21849--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Touch</span><span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">é!</span>
</p><!--l. 21851--><p class="indent" >  “I am quite familiar with the analysis. And this is why the government are willing
to pay so well for the services. You oﬀer a unique kind of skill.”
</p><!--l. 21855--><p class="indent" >  “Yes we do,” feeling more pleased.
</p><!--l. 21857--><p class="indent" >  “And now you are involved in this infamous game technology. You must be
pleased, for your company, I mean.”
</p><!--l. 21860--><p class="indent" >  “It is good news for us, yes. The oﬀers keep rolling in.”
</p><!--l. 21862--><p class="indent" >  “Indeed. But what about your Miss Kim? has she oﬀered to pay for your
services?”
</p><!--l. 21864--><p class="indent" >  “Why would she do that?”

</p><!--l. 21866--><p class="indent" >  “Because she works for the government I believe. Though to be honest, I am not
completely sure what she does. But I believe that she has been tasked to ﬁnd out what
is going on in the extremist game lobbies.”
</p><!--l. 21871--><p class="indent" >  “I believe she does some contract work for the government and law enforcement.
She does research into security in the game infrastructure.”
</p><!--l. 21875--><p class="indent" >  “Perhaps. But she is harmless. There were others at that meeting who were far more
dangerous. Perhaps you know who I mean?”
</p><!--l. 21878--><p class="indent" >  Den raises an eyebrow. “I can guess.”
</p><!--l. 21880--><p class="indent" >  “I have no doubt that they have been in contact with you, and that they want to use
your privileged access in the game for promoting various, let&#x2019;s say, opinions. I wonder
what you think about all that.”
</p><!--l. 21885--><p class="indent" >  “That sounds like politics.”
</p><!--l. 21887--><p class="indent" >  “Yes it does. And that is why we are here.”
</p><!--l. 21889--><p class="indent" >  He assimilates the information and nods. “You seem to know a lot about
me.”
</p><!--l. 21891--><p class="indent" >  “It is my job to follow what is going on.” She gestures around her. “I have many
projects and I am involved with many companies. We are information experts. My
role in all of this has changed over the years, as I have come to understand more
about the workings of the world. I spend a lot of my time now in political
analysis.”
</p><!--l. 21897--><p class="indent" >  “I thought you didn&#x2019;t like politics.”
</p><!--l. 21899--><p class="indent" >  “That is why I study it. You keep your enemies close, no?” She smiles at him, with
a touch of amusement. “I study the trends and try to understand what is happening and
who is responsible. Then I try to ﬁt my own vision into that picture, so that I can
succeed.”
</p><!--l. 21904--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I&#x2019;m assuming it works then.”
</p><!--l. 21906--><p class="indent" >  “Of course it does. We are good at what we do. Perhaps the best in the world at
certain aspects of data mining. But you have not answered my question,” she says.
“What you think of these groups who would like to make use of your privileged
access to the game.”
</p><!--l. 21911--><p class="indent" >  Den regards her with purposeful equanimity, hiding his uncertainty as well as he
can.
</p><!--l. 21914--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">How the hell should I know what to think?</span>
</p><!--l. 21916--><p class="indent" >  “I am not sure what to think yet,” he tries. “It has all come quite suddenly, and there
has been a lot of rumour and innuendo after the article let the cat out about the U.S:
government&#x2019;s involvement. So, I am considering things, but not jumping to any
conclusions yet.”
</p><!--l. 21921--><p class="indent" >  She regards him with her probing eyes, as if trying to look directly into his head. He
feels the beams ransacking his body language. “Good, then you have an open mind. I
like that. An open mind is a thinking mind.”
</p><!--l. 21925--><p class="indent" >  “I consider everything very carefully in my work,” he says, projecting conﬁdence
now. “Our job is to understand people, their intentions and their audience. Perhaps out
jobs are not so diﬀerent in some ways?”

</p><!--l. 21929--><p class="indent" >  She smiles.
</p><!--l. 21931--><p class="indent" >  “But I am guessing that you have a motive in asking the question? Do you
have an angle of your own on this? What is it that you want from me, Ms.
Cortina?”
</p><!--l. 21935--><p class="indent" >  She regards him for several seconds, nodding, as if thinking or considering what to
say. Then she takes a breath and looks out of the window as she launches into
soliloquy.
</p><!--l. 21939--><p class="indent" >  “The institutions of government have become more polarized in recent years, don&#x2019;t
you think? That is true everywhere, but it is most true in the U.S. There are pro- and
anti-religious groups, and pro- and anti-war groups.”
</p><!--l. 21944--><p class="indent" >  He nods.
</p><!--l. 21946--><p class="indent" >  “The secularizers are trying to protect themselves against the church, who are
making inroads into politics again. Both of them want to control the country, but
neither of them has done anything other than split the country into fragments. The
more they close their doors to each other, the more they loathe each other, the more
polarized it all becomes. It&#x2019;s a resonance in a wine glass, and the glass just
broke.”
</p><!--l. 21954--><p class="indent" >  “So the fat lady is singing?”
</p><!--l. 21956--><p class="indent" >  She smiles. “Let us seriously hope not. In Europe, the state Lutheran churches, the
Anglican church, the Norwegian State Church, and so on, these all were formed in
reaction to the political power of Rome. When people talk about religion,
they imagine it has to do with spiritual matters, but it was really just our
beta version of politics. Since then, there have been treaties: the separation
of church and state, et cetera, et cetera. Well politics is now brewing up a
storm.”
</p><!--l. 21964--><p class="indent" >  “Religious forces are more prominent in politics than before.”
</p><!--l. 21966--><p class="indent" >  “They are more prominent, and their beliefs are based on superﬁcialities
and reactionary ignorance to the information age. The idea of free access to
information is a double edged sword. Organized religion has always been
about believing without proof. The information age oﬀers proof without
belief. It is an unpleasant reality for the churches and mosques around the
world.”
</p><!--l. 21973--><p class="indent" >  “Isn&#x2019;t Spain a Catholic country? Aren&#x2019;t you supposed to be on the side of the
church?” he jokes, trying to inject some humour into her passion, but his
charm is not a useful weapon here. She is passionate and does not respond to
deﬂection.
</p><!--l. 21978--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">It would be fun to try to get to the bottom of her passion</span>, he thinks.
</p><!--l. 21980--><p class="indent" >  His eyes scan her ﬁgure, admiring her, in the instant of a pause for breath. She
seems to notice his attention and her demeanour changes instantly. She pauses for
breath as annoyance is reigned in and she softens.
</p><!--l. 21985--><p class="indent" >  “They have targeted you, Den. Both sides. That girl is there to seduce you for the
side of the government, and I don&#x2019;t doubt for a moment that you were contacted in
San Diego by the pro-religious group.”

</p><!--l. 21990--><p class="indent" >  “What makes you say that? How can you know all this?”
</p><!--l. 21992--><p class="indent" >  “Isn&#x2019;t it obvious to you?”
</p><!--l. 21994--><p class="indent" >  “I can understand your worry, but do you actually think that I am so interesting as
to warrant that much attention.”
</p><!--l. 21997--><p class="indent" >  “Please, Mr. Morris”, she switches to his English salutation. “I am not a fool. This
is something that I work on. Vascon is expert in this ﬁeld. I employ and work with the
best minds. Our company works with police forces around the world to perform
analyses. All of this fragmentation, all of this rioting and terrorism that is growing in
our midst, it is not just a coincidence. It is a symptom of a fragmentation of society at
the deepest level. There are many groups trying to win dominance, but the most
important ones are the ones who control the resources of the most important
country.”
</p><!--l. 22007--><p class="indent" >  “America.”
</p><!--l. 22009--><p class="indent" >  “America. But who controls the world, do you think?” She does not wait for an
answer. “There is no world government, Mr Morris. Throughout history, who has
controlled it? National governments? Is it the G7, G8, G12? Or Fortune 100, 500 and
so on? Certainly not the U.N.. There is a ﬁnite number of political units and governing
entities. Not just one. The number is growing all the time. Harmony is disappearing.
But for the moment, there is still a concentration of these people around government
structures, because the law makers and law enforcement bodies are focused
there.”
</p><!--l. 22019--><p class="indent" >  “Governments are losing control.” He knows it is true. “And they are speculating in
the ways of old fashioned propaganda once again.”
</p><!--l. 22022--><p class="indent" >  “There is nothing old fashioned about it. It has always been going on. But in the
information age, you have to work harder to keep people&#x2019;s allegiance. They are
being tempted by alternatives all the time. With countries like Russia and
Japan rewriting the history of their warring pasts, removing atrocities and
generating a heroic mythology, people will soon be back to their former state of
ignorance. With countries like the United States rewriting textbooks in a literal
biblical interpretation, ignoring science, you are looking at the replacement
of thought with a simple slogan. This is a good strategy for turning back
the hands of time, back to a dark age where the government controls the
information.”
</p><!--l. 22034--><p class="indent" >  “But we are a long way from anarchy.”
</p><!--l. 22036--><p class="indent" >  “Well, some people might like to sweep away the courts or the police to make it
easier for them to rise to dominance, but for the time being they cannot. As
long as there are people who believe in those institutions, they have a head
start.”
</p><!--l. 22041--><p class="indent" >  “That sounds dramatic.”
</p><!--l. 22043--><p class="indent" >  “Of course it is temporary.”
</p><!--l. 22045--><p class="indent" >  “So there is unrest. We have all seen the riots and the rise in gang activities.”
</p><!--l. 22048--><p class="indent" >  “No, it is deeper than that. There is the usual constant shuﬄing, but we are in a
break-up phase. Split oﬀ a piece, reintegrate, absorb back into a fold. Dissonance

followed by reharmonization. The cycle is constantly going around, and we are in
break-up. It is really an information conﬂict – a war between diﬀerent parts of the
information.”
</p><!--l. 22055--><p class="indent" >  “Why do you say it is a war?”
</p><!--l. 22057--><p class="indent" >  She smiles now, apparently pleased at having interested him in an intellectual
discussion. Posturing has progressed to debate. “Dynamics of the information. This is
what we live and breathe here at Vascon. Sorry. Let me think.”
</p><!--l. 22062--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">What does a woman do when she wants to stroke her beard in thought? </span>Den
thinks.
</p><!--l. 22064--><p class="indent" >  “All right,” she says. “What about this? Consider how we humans organize
ourselves. According to psycho-anthropology there is a limit to the number of others
we can cope with at any time, so we fragment into identities and type labels. So,
suppose you have a boundaries that are drawn by surname. You base your world map
on everyone whose surnames match. As time goes on, someone disagrees with this
partitioning of the world, and the edges begin to leak. People change allegiances and
form new groups, either consciously or unconsciously. They reclassify themselves,
drawing new boundaries. Before you know what has happened, they have organized
themselves by sex, or by age. Then it all happens over again and it is skin
colour or religion this time. This is what we have learned from Biotech. Genes
are doing this all the time, as the environment forces a reevaluation of their
usefulness.”
</p><!--l. 22079--><p class="indent" >  “I see what you mean. It&#x2019;s just like consumer groups and targets in marketing.”
</p><!--l. 22082--><p class="indent" >  “Exactly. There is a whole environment of little signals that are making us
change our minds. And we politicize it, because we are territorial. Fixed border
geography is really not so diﬀerent. If you just ﬁgure out the relevant scales for the
dynamics.”
</p><!--l. 22088--><p class="indent" >  “Fish scales? Music scales? Dynamics? This is not really my ﬁeld. I&#x2019;ll have to trust
you on that.”
</p><!--l. 22091--><p class="indent" >  She smiles, appreciating the concession. but she fails to laugh. “Action scales.” Her
body language tells him that she is apologizing for using technicalities to win points.
She was not showing oﬀ. She adds: “You see, there is a lot of interest in the game,
because people believe that it can aﬀect the attitudes of young people. Change their
allegiances.”
</p><!--l. 22098--><p class="indent" >  He decides to reciprocate her display of trust. “Yes. And I can tell you that I have
deﬁnitely been approached by people wanting to send their messages and program
kids properly. Both in the oﬃcial government and in religious groups within the
government”
</p><!--l. 22103--><p class="indent" >  “Thank you for saying that. And yet, you know, I am not so sure that they are really
going to achieve their goals using the game.”
</p><!--l. 22106--><p class="indent" >  “Why not?”
</p><!--l. 22108--><p class="indent" >  “Well the usual idea is games are a bad inﬂuence on people: sex and violence, you
know—that the power of suggestion is quite strong in the imagery and the types of
actions. Violent actions are supposed to leave a lasting inﬂuence. The same

thing with soap operas and lifestyle programming. But games are actually
diﬀerent.”
</p><!--l. 22114--><p class="indent" >  “How so?”
</p><!--l. 22116--><p class="indent" >  “They are interactive. The players make decisions and become more concerned
with the problem aspect than with the scenery. In that sense the game develops an
important intellectual skill. The action is even more cerebral than the conservative
commentators would give it credit for.”
</p><!--l. 22122--><p class="indent" >  “So what is your interest.”
</p><!--l. 22124--><p class="indent" >  “The main problem that is frightening is the problem of dumbing down. Education
is my passion. A dying passion, but it is our only way out of the break-up
phase.”
</p><!--l. 22128--><p class="indent" >  “And yet we are in an information age, where there has never been more available
knowledge out there.”
</p><!--l. 22131--><p class="indent" >  “But there is also just as much junk out there. More distraction. It is only the simple
slogans that reach out to people now. Do you know why Spanish people for a long
time spoke few foreign languages? Because Franco wanted to prevent people from
leaving his dictatorship, or getting information from outside. It was forbidden to learn
a language that was beyond his control.”
</p><!--l. 22138--><p class="indent" >  “I know academics complain about ignorance of mathematics and English. It hasn&#x2019;t
occurred to me that it goes any deeper than that.”
</p><!--l. 22141--><p class="indent" >  “Mathematics, reading, literature, science, logic. Doctrine and platitudes are
pushing out real thinking and they have been doing so for years, ever since
some smart do-gooder said that it was wrong to foster elitism. Every sorry
child can feel good about themselves, no matter what they think or fail to
think.”
</p><!--l. 22147--><p class="indent" >  “We have become a lead-by-the-nose culture. It&#x2019;s true.”
</p><!--l. 22149--><p class="indent" >  “But if everyone is just following a few leaders, then you just have mass ignorance.
Society cannot move forward. It will move backwards. Thinkers are radicals,
heretics, by their nature. No one thanks an innovator for saying there is room for
change.”
</p><!--l. 22155--><p class="indent" >  “So,” he says, “summarizing here. If I understand you, you are saying that we have
to keep a broad base of opinions and skills. People have to realize that the dumbing
down of our societies is not merely a problem of culture of entertainment industries.
This is not about reality television or voyeurism. The culture of ignorance has
inﬁltrated our most hallowed institutions.”
</p><!--l. 22162--><p class="indent" >  “Thank you,” she says. “That is exactly right.”
</p><!--l. 22164--><p class="indent" >  “So let me tell you about a project that I have. I have asked you here to help build a
jigsaw puzzle,” she says. “I already own several of the companies involved in the
outsourcing. I want to assemble the tools to put real thinking back on the
map.”
</p><!--l. 22169--><p class="indent" >  “You&#x2019;re on a ﬁshing trip.”
</p><!--l. 22171--><p class="indent" >  She smiles. “In a sense. Spanish traders have been coming to Northern Europe for
years ﬁshing. They say that the boats that crashed on the western coast of Norway and

on the East of the United Kingdom are responsible for the dark hair and skin in that
part of the population.”
</p><!--l. 22177--><p class="indent" >  “And you think you can take on the forces of ignorance that are spreading out from
the religious groups: the evangelical churches and the madrassas.” He feigns a
pious voice: “And an angel of knowledge appeared to me. She said that help
was coming. Follow the path to knowledge and ﬁnd out what is up God&#x2019;s
skirt.”
</p><!--l. 22183--><p class="indent" >  “There is something you might not know about the reason why you are needed by
the church supporters..”
</p><!--l. 22186--><p class="indent" >  “And what might that be?”
</p><!--l. 22188--><p class="indent" >  “Politics. A Bill for congress. A bill that will give them the power to control the
police and the army on moral grounds.”
</p><!--l. 22191--><p class="indent" >  “What? What are you saying?” He frowns. “Why wouldn&#x2019;t I know about
this?”
</p><!--l. 22194--><p class="indent" >  “Far be it for me to spread rumours, Señor Morris, but there are many organizations
in the world with agendas of their own. There are racial groups, religious groups,
clubs and elites.”
</p><!--l. 22198--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s not a reason.” He smiles. “I had my suspicions.”
</p><!--l. 22200--><p class="indent" >  “Did you know that the Basque people are a unique race, with a special interest in
their identity?”
</p><!--l. 22204--><p class="indent" >  “The Neanderthals?”
</p><!--l. 22206--><p class="indent" >  “No, Neanderthals are what crawls out of a British pub at closing time. You are
possibly thinking of the Cro Magnon theory.”
</p><!--l. 22209--><p class="indent" >  “Right.”
</p><!--l. 22211--><p class="indent" >  She is ﬂirting with him now, but Den can see that it would be futile to reciprocate.
She has him in the palm of her very well manicured hand and he is humbled by her
mastery of him.
</p><!--l. 22215--><p class="indent" >  “So planning these threads is a very complicated business.”
</p><!--l. 22217--><p class="indent" >  “Recuerderos de La Alhambra,” she says.
</p><!--l. 22219--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m sorry?”
</p><!--l. 22221--><p class="indent" >  She sends him a long hard look, some of that warmth leaking away. She suppresses
an almost pitying chill that tells him that she thinks he is an uncultured barbarian.
Then her face softens as if she forgives him his ignorance in the passing of a single
moment.
</p><!--l. 22226--><p class="indent" >  “It is a piece of guitar music. Very diﬃcult to play.” Her eyes are ﬁery in intensity.
“It is a marathon of tremolo passages as intricate as the mosaics and as sweeping as
the gardens of the Alhambra palace. It requires a feat of manual dexterity and
endurance that few players possess. At the same time it requires great delicacy of
interpretation. It is easy to make it sound like a computer program or a gatling gun.
The nuances require great skill. Playing the piece is a challenge, but the status that
being able to play it brings to musicians is worth perhaps more than the piece
itself.”
</p><!--l. 22236--><p class="indent" >  “You are not saying the piece doesn&#x2019;t have any intrinsic artistic value?”

</p><!--l. 22238--><p class="indent" >  “Of course not. But always with a piece of art, there is more than the sum of the
parts. Perhaps it is also a lesson? Remember what happened to the Islamic
Empire in Granada.” She pauses to study his response as if evaluating his
performance. No, nothing there. “The Alhambra was created as a palace of ﬁnancial,
artistic and cultural splendour in the thirteenth century. It was conquered ﬁrst
by the Christians and then by Tourists. Now it is a theme park, devoid of
dignity.”
</p><!--l. 22246--><p class="indent" >  “There is dignity in culture, surely.”
</p><!--l. 22248--><p class="indent" >  “Tourism is not culture. It is consumerism. Anyway, we digress. I think you are not
so much fascinated by the piece as by the status that it brings. For you it is not the art,
but the ownership. You are an art dealer, not an artist.”
</p><!--l. 22253--><p class="indent" >  Den regards here with a curiosity. He is uncertain as to whether he has been
insulted or simply provoked.
</p><!--l. 22256--><p class="indent" >  “My point is that we must be cautious and subtle. What we must do to reverse the
inﬂuence of ignorance is not merely create prestige projects, we must master
the delicacy of art. Not mass produced consumer messages, but seductive
melodies.”
</p><!--l. 22261--><p class="indent" >  Den responds to the change in her. She seems more attractive to him now. She
has boiled oﬀ an outer protective layer and her defences have been partially
lowered. He considers what he should do. If this is his chance to maximize his
importance in the game business, then he should try to win her approval. On the
other hand, she is interesting and clearly motivated. Can she even see me? he
wonders.
</p><!--l. 22268--><p class="indent" >  “What about the game then?” he suggests. “Do you think it is a good thing or a bad
thing? You were at the meeting in San Diego, so you must have some interest
in the game?” Unconsciously, he uses a body language that he uses when
interested in a woman for quite diﬀerent reasons. It is involuntary, but she notices
and wriggles in her chair, pulling her jacket lapels closer together, as if in
discomfort.
</p><!--l. 22275--><p class="indent" >  He kicks himself mentally. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Not now, idiot.</span>
</p><!--l. 22277--><p class="indent" >  “Games are like glue,” she says, more coldly. “Civil governments want to do gluon
engineering. They want to win back hearts and minds, and bind everyone together
with a message of freedom and, above all, authority. They want your allegiance, not to
a ﬂag, but to their manifesto.”
</p><!--l. 22283--><p class="indent" >  “And they want to exploit this glue to galvanize support for the Bill?”
</p><!--l. 22285--><p class="indent" >  “Today everyone is more desperate. They can see what is going on. They want to
bind people back together into a stable society—the old fashioned kind, in which they
are still boss. They see a massive de-centralization of power, made possible by our
communications technology, and they want to reinstate their centralization of power
and ideology. They want people to bow down to them again, to put it crudely. They
still need a basis in law.”
</p><!--l. 22293--><p class="indent" >  “So what is it that you want? I am confused about whether you agree with that or
disagree.”

</p><!--l. 22296--><p class="indent" >  “What are we really talking about – what they are asking you to help them do – is
to spread messages, not simple slogans but more complex psychological iterations.
The timing will be critical. When the people are asked to vote with their mobiles, they
want the answer to be ‘yes&#x2019;. It is more like training a dog than lecturing to a
crowd.”
</p><!--l. 22302--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s them. What about you?”
</p><!--l. 22304--><p class="indent" >  “I want the ideology, which is spread, to be one that is based on critical discussion,
ideas, crazy passions and rational thinking, all together – not pea-brained propaganda
and certainly not if it leads to a massive increase in power for the forces of
ignorance.” Her hands reach out, as if she is holding a child. “The game is
the key. Science, research, call it what you like: these are all just a forms of
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">play</span>. Intellectual recreation. Kids who never grew up. It is advanced play
with discipline. It is about playing games of a diﬀerent kind: intelligence
games, creative games. It&#x2019;s about asking other people to decipher your puzzle.
Without these games, the human spirit of exploration stops. We are just . . .
clay.”
</p><!--l. 22316--><p class="indent" >  “So you think the game is a good thing? Even if it is being used for broadcasting
someone&#x2019;s ideology?” Idiot, that is what she just said. He tries, too late, to give the
appearance of someone going over the facts, rather than someone asking
questions.
</p><!--l. 22321--><p class="indent" >  She seems to be losing patience. “Play is a good thing. Active creativity – not
passive consumerism, not edicts from the church. On the other hand, we must
be cautious of how we rate the outcome of that creativity. The power of an
idea should not be underestimated. It has happened many times throughout
history: an idea is ﬂung around the world, impinging on these individuals like
a cosmic pinball game. Somehow, because the idea joins people together,
implicitly, their lives become intertwined. It blossoms and spreads. Is that good or
bad? I think it simply happens. You cannot necessarily judge the outcome in
advance.”
</p><!--l. 22332--><p class="indent" >  “But you need a big enough mixture of ideas, a big enough gene pool to choose
from.”
</p><!--l. 22335--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, I agree. And we keep that gene pool alive by fostering a spirit of playing and
learning. We are not saying that children will be singing songs of science, and we
certainly don&#x2019;t want them praying to Darwin.”
</p><!--l. 22339--><p class="indent" >  “Not ignorant acceptance,” he agrees, as the thought percolates into his deeper
consciousness, beyond the surface banter. “The human spirit.”
</p><!--l. 22343--><p class="indent" >  “Ignorance is only good for corruption,” she points out. “It breeds mobs, by
whatever name. The mob wants to keep its own group strong, and everyone else weak
and vulnerable. The real heroes of any age are the artists and thinkers who
passionately follow their path of discovery. Discoverers. How can we stand still
without them? We are used to change now. It has to happen. It is the theory
of the Red Queen. Do you know it? That we have to run very fast to stand
still?”

</p><!--l. 22351--><p class="indent" >  He shakes his head. “Perhaps you can tell me about it over dinner sometime, when
we are more relaxed.”
</p><!--l. 22354--><p class="indent" >  “We do not have time for that,” she snaps in admonishment.
</p><!--l. 22356--><p class="indent" >  “Well, one day when we have more time.” He is tired and his sense of winning this
encounter is slipping away.
</p><!--l. 22359--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">What is it I&#x2019;m trying to win though?</span>
</p><!--l. 22361--><p class="indent" >  “Cristo,” she mutters. “Tell me something, Mr. Morris, I am curious as to what they
are asking you to do. Especially the pro-church lobby. They are asking you to
work for them, no? Let me see, I am guessing that they have a two-layered
strategy. The anti-abortion propaganda is a constant distraction. Not that.
They have their ﬁxed campaigns, and then they have other more surreptitious
campaigns which are less visible. I think it is this. But your speciality is in smart
surfaces.”
</p><!--l. 22370--><p class="indent" >  He decides a conciliatory approach. “In the game, they are talking about using it as
a form of government. They are talking about consolidating government into a single
globalized entity.”

</p><!--l. 22377--><p class="indent" >  “I suppose not?”
</p><!--l. 22379--><p class="indent" >  “A world government would have to be a pretty symbolic aﬀair. You cannot force
every decision, every ruling through a single bottleneck. It couldn&#x2019;t possibly work.
Though I suppose you can have a media ﬁgure that talks about high level goals,
common ethical standards and so on. . .certainly. A ﬁgurehead.”
</p><!--l. 22384--><p class="indent" >  She makes the idea ridiculous. They have become opposing sparring partners again,
not team players on the same side.
</p><!--l. 22387--><p class="indent" >  “We have learned the need to distribution of eﬀort, devolution of control.”
</p><!--l. 22389--><p class="indent" >  “Isn&#x2019;t centralization a sign of strong leadership?”
</p><!--l. 22391--><p class="indent" >  “No, no. It&#x2019;s no good at all. The trouble with the old centralized system, which is
essentially bureaucratic, is that it cannot solve problems – increasing bureaucratic
controls simply creates more and more preconditions for corruption. It is the paradox
of government. The more you try to control, the more of it slips through the back-door
by abuse of privilege.”
</p><!--l. 22398--><p class="indent" >  Den tries to reverse the change of mood by her oﬀering something.
</p><!--l. 22401--><p class="indent" >  “This must remain between the two of us,” he tells her.
</p><!--l. 22403--><p class="indent" >  She nods, eyes cutting into him again.
</p><!--l. 22405--><p class="indent" >  “The campaign they want is broad. Everything from billboards to role playing. It is
image creating in a way that makes people look away from the real things that they are
doing, and it keeps the masses satisﬁed.”
</p><!--l. 22410--><p class="indent" >  “Yes. Good. Tell me more.”
</p><!--l. 22412--><p class="indent" >  He tells her about the meeting he had with the splinter group. He shouldn&#x2019;t, but he
needs to win points with her.
</p><!--l. 22415--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I am not good at keeping secrets, </span>he thinks, thinking of Cathy Kim.
</p><!--l. 22417--><p class="indent" >  “We have only started to discuss strategy. We have some doubts about wanting to be
involved at all.”

</p><!--l. 22420--><p class="indent" >  “There are many ways to control people,” she muses.
</p><!--l. 22422--><p class="indent" >  “The approach is not likely to be anything radical. It&#x2019;s all standard tricks.
Encouragement, guilt, contrary instruction. You know, tell people not to do X, so that
you can guarantee certain groups will do both X and X-squared.”
</p><!--l. 22427--><p class="indent" >  “Will it be enough?”
</p><!--l. 22429--><p class="indent" >  “We usually do okay in these campaigns.”
</p><!--l. 22431--><p class="indent" >  “Will you truly activate people&#x2019;s minds? From poets to technicians? We need
suﬃcient diversity of skills and understanding to survive into the coming generations.
That requires a long term commitment, a deep investment.”
</p><!--l. 22436--><p class="indent" >  “The money is there.”
</p><!--l. 22438--><p class="indent" >  “The preeminent paradigm of our time is: short term return. This is precisely why
things are falling apart now. Get rich quick, as the American&#x2019;s say!”
</p><!--l. 22442--><p class="indent" >  He lifts his head wearily. “No adverbs.”
</p><!--l. 22444--><p class="indent" >  She returns his enigmatic remark by regarding him curiously.
</p><!--l. 22446--><p class="indent" >  Never mind. “I have understood your point.” He wants to call her by a name, but he
is not sure what she would allow him to call her. Ms Cortina? Connie? They could all
backﬁre. “You are saying that we need more complex messages for people to absorb,
to reach out to peoples&#x2019; intelligent side.”
</p><!--l. 22452--><p class="indent" >  “Make people smarter, Señor Morris. We must all play a role in this. ”
</p><!--l. 22454--><p class="indent" >  “Advertising is supposed to be a simple message though, unambiguous. .
.”
</p><!--l. 22456--><p class="indent" >  “It doesn&#x2019;t have to be. Compare advertising from diﬀerent countries. There is a
world of diﬀerence, no?”
</p><!--l. 22459--><p class="indent" >  He recalls his recent experience in San Diego with toothpaste and agrees. “Yes, of
course, marketing campaigns can make mistakes sometimes—putting all their eggs in
one basket. The one size ﬁts all idea. Lowest common denominator. It never really
works, but it is cheap.”
</p><!--l. 22465--><p class="indent" >  “The money is there.”
</p><!--l. 22467--><p class="indent" >  “Sometimes a counter information campaign works,” he mutters on. “Scandal? No,
there&#x2019;s too much noise in the paparazzi these days to make a scandal work. Everything
is a scandal.”
</p><!--l. 22471--><p class="indent" >  “Even during the cold war, the days of large scale overt propaganda, we had more
complex ways of making us believe we were better than the other side. There pomp
and circumstance of ceremony. Showing that your army, your, uniform, your
headquarters are bigger than the other side&#x2019;s.”
</p><!--l. 22477--><p class="indent" >  “We are a ceremonial culture in Europe,” he recites.
</p><!--l. 22479--><p class="indent" >  “Ceremony addresses our spiritual needs, without having to be religious.”
</p><!--l. 22482--><p class="indent" >  He nods, losing himself in all of these thoughts.
</p><!--l. 22484--><p class="indent" >  <span

</p><!--l. 22487--><p class="indent" >  He sighs. feeling suddenly exhausted. A ﬁnal show of weakness. He looks her up
and down once more, admiring her strength. She notices his wandering and sighs
herself.

</p><!--l. 22491--><p class="indent" >  “Think with your mind, Señor Morris. Education is vital to our future. Society is
dumbing down too quickly. You need to help us change that. I ask you to bear this in
mind when you are working for these groups. Don&#x2019;t let them succeed in making
society stupider.”
</p><!--l. 22496--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ll think about what you&#x2019;ve said,” he says.
</p><!--l. 22498--><p class="indent" >  She looks grave for a fraction of a second, so that Den feels as though he has hit a
nerve. Then her expression lightens and she smiles. “And now I have other things to
attend to, so you will have to excuse me.”
</p><!--l. 22503--><p class="indent" >  She rises, as if commanding him to do the same. His renewed posturing has
managed to annoy her, he can tell.
</p><!--l. 22506--><p class="indent" >  “Do you want to make a follow up appointment?” he asks. ”Perhaps you would like
to visit me in London?”
</p><!--l. 22509--><p class="indent" >  She snorts, like a compassionate bull in the ring, smiling at the witless Matador out
of pity. “I think that will not be necessary.”
</p><!--l. 22513--><p class="indent" >  He examines her cold planar face, looking for a hint that she might be impressed by
some aspect of him.
</p><!--l. 22516--><p class="indent" >  The meter reads zero.
</p><!--l. 22518--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ll show you out now, Mr. Morris.”

fending oﬀ all the pedestrians in the busy streets, winding himself up over Christina,
and going without sleep for several nights. It has drained him mentally and physically.
With almost compulsive futility, he checks his messages one more time, sizing his
own predicament; it is one of desperation.
</p><!--l. 22533--><p class="indent" >  <span

</p><!--l. 22535--><p class="indent" >  In the wild aftermath, after civilization fell, he would be dead meat. He would not
survive without his computer. It isn&#x2019;t really like a VR game, is it? It&#x2019;s much harder
without clear rules and a portable pizza oven. His combo subjects him to more
humiliation:

have been taunting him and making him an object of fun, ever since he let slip about
Christina. Seeking refuge in work is not always a story for success. He is still too

</p><!--l. 22561--><p class="indent" >  “Hello?” Christina&#x2019;s voice says. She sounds confused or even annoyed as if she was
not expecting anyone. Perhaps she was sleeping? It&#x2019;s not late.

now.
</p><!--l. 22570--><p class="indent" >  “So what are you doing?”
</p><!--l. 22572--><p class="indent" >  “Nothing much.” The television is playing in the background.

</p><!--l. 22576--><p class="indent" >  There is a slight pause and her voice becomes evasive. “Oh, no, I can&#x2019;t. It&#x2019;s such a

</p><!--l. 22581--><p class="indent" >  He hears a laugh, a male voice, in response to some audience laughter on the
television. She has company.
</p><!--l. 22584--><p class="indent" >  “I need to clean up ﬁrst. I&#x2019;ll call you another time.”

</p><!--l. 22598--><p class="indent" >  “Are you okay?” she asks.

</p><!--l. 22600--><p class="indent" >  He turns his head away, and tries to look busy. “Uh, yeah. What can I do for
you?”
</p><!--l. 22603--><p class="indent" >  She cocks her head. “You look even paler than usual. You could use a
break.”
</p><!--l. 22605--><p class="indent" >  “You look . . .” He considers lashing out, but reins himself in, like a good dog,
snatching a glance at her. “Nice.” She probably doesn&#x2019;t mean to be butting in on his
aﬀairs. It was a kind gesture to ask about him.
</p><!--l. 22610--><p class="indent" >  “Thank you very much,” she says with the very cute Indian lilt. “You know, I was
wondering if you wanted to go out this evening. I haven&#x2019;t had a chance to do anything
like this for a long time. While I am here I want to sample the nightlife here, feel as
though I am actually alive.”
</p><!--l. 22616--><p class="indent" >  Yes, alive. What is that exactly? “I am pretty busy. . .”
</p><!--l. 22619--><p class="indent" >  “It looks as though you could do with a night oﬀ.”
</p><!--l. 22621--><p class="indent" >  “Yes.” He nods, mainly to himself. He is not doing anything useful. “Yes, I
could.”
</p><!--l. 22624--><p class="indent" >  She edges her way into his oﬃce a little further, without invitation. She is trying to
be nice to him. Why? Anyway, he should be grateful.
</p><!--l. 22627--><p class="indent" >  “Did I tell you what I found out?”
</p><!--l. 22629--><p class="indent" >  “What?”
</p><!--l. 22631--><p class="indent" >  “I am not a real person.”
</p><!--l. 22633--><p class="indent" >  Dermot looks at her, wondering what she is trying to say. “Well, don&#x2019;t ask me. I
can&#x2019;t tell the diﬀerence.”
</p><!--l. 22636--><p class="indent" >  She grins, and he is forced to laugh at his own remark.
</p><!--l. 22638--><p class="indent" >  “I am a character in someone&#x2019;s game.”
</p><!--l. 22640--><p class="indent" >  The humour drains out of him. “So, are you going to explain that, or just leave me
guessing?”
</p><!--l. 22643--><p class="indent" >  “I found out. Your boss is part of a network that has been manipulating
me, choreographing my moves ever since I started working on the game in
Malaysia.”
</p><!--l. 22647--><p class="indent" >  “What? Why?”
</p><!--l. 22649--><p class="indent" >  “From what I can tell, they needed someone under cover to get inside the
information in the game.”
</p><!--l. 22652--><p class="indent" >  “A spy?”
</p><!--l. 22654--><p class="indent" >  “An involuntary spy.”
</p><!--l. 22656--><p class="indent" >  “A stooge.”
</p><!--l. 22658--><p class="indent" >  “I suppose it amounts to that, doesn&#x2019;t it? You know the strangest thing about
it?”
</p><!--l. 22661--><p class="indent" >  “What?”
</p><!--l. 22663--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t really care.”
</p><!--l. 22665--><p class="indent" >  “You don&#x2019;t care?”
</p><!--l. 22668--><p class="indent" >  She shrugs. “No, I don&#x2019;t care.”
</p><!--l. 22670--><p class="indent" >  “Why not, I mean. . .”
</p><!--l. 22672--><p class="indent" >  She meets his gaze. “I&#x2019;m better oﬀ, aren&#x2019;t I?”

</p><!--l. 22674--><p class="indent" >  He can identify with that.
</p><!--l. 22676--><p class="indent" >  “Do you think that attack on you was set up too?”
</p><!--l. 22678--><p class="indent" >  “What!?” A bolt of disgust breaks her expression. She gasps, bordering on a
scream.
</p><!--l. 22681--><p class="indent" >  “The attack. You said you were kidnapped, I mean. Right?”
</p><!--l. 22683--><p class="indent" >  “What? You mean, it could have been engineered to bring me here?”
</p><!--l. 22686--><p class="indent" >  “Just an idea. What better way to make you help them than to make you think that a
well-known enemy is out to get you. They step in to the rescue and bring you here. It
all seems very convenient. ” There is a quiver in his voice, as if he realizes that he has
gone too far.
</p><!--l. 22691--><p class="indent" >  Her eyes are wide and she precesses like a gyroscope in the doorway. “Would
someone arrange an attack on me to manipulate me?”
</p><!--l. 22694--><p class="indent" >  “Well, we might do something like that in a game. So, I mean, you know, it could. .
. It was just a thought.”
</p><!--l. 22697--><p class="indent" >  “Shut up! Don&#x2019;t say it!”

</p><!--l. 22718--><p class="indent" >  “Yes.” He suppresses an instinct to correct the details of what she said. That is a bad

</p><!--l. 22722--><p class="indent" >  “Got anywhere?”

tea.”
</p><!--l. 22748--><p class="indent" >  “Black or green?” she asks.
</p><!--l. 22750--><p class="indent" >  “Black, plain or with vanilla.”
</p><!--l. 22752--><p class="indent" >  She smiles. “Plain, please. So, something else. I found a connection using my

have some of the technology that we need. I don&#x2019;t know how it works, but I ﬁgured

out into the chill winter vapours. It does not do to see the repairs that maintain the

Pockmarks in the asphalt foundations are quietly being steam-rollered into
denial by night-workers, under halogen illumination and ﬂashing amber.
The city is sinking into a marsh; like Atlantis, he thinks. How long do we

</p><!--l. 22780--><p class="indent" >  The homeless are hanging in the recesses of shuttered shop doorways now, as if
driven out of their usual haunts by a gathering storm. Dermot&#x2019;s mobile indicates that
there is a police alert in the city tonight. A football game. That means there will be
police everywhere. It is seldom that he ventures out of a tram or a bus at this time of
day, in such caustic air. Besides, he is usually working. Dermot the action
hero.
</p><!--l. 22788--><p class="indent" >  They are ﬁve puﬀed up blimps feeling their way forward, towards the a place
rumoured to be known to one of them, none of them certain of where they are going.
They are a blind gang leading a stranger through the night; rosy cheeks, slapped by

paving. They are standing out too much. The few people around are watching them.
Where are the police? Why can&#x2019;t they see any police? If they are suppose to be out in
force, why aren&#x2019;t they here?

</p><!--l. 22801--><p class="indent" >  As if to laugh at him, a black cat shifts in a shadow, raised momentarily from its
smug camouﬂage by the tenderest kiss of ambient light.

</p><!--l. 22809--><p class="indent" >  “Come on, Dermot,” Preeta said. “Take a break. Let&#x2019;s go out and have a good
time!” She smiled, bearing a wicked streak. “I&#x2019;ve always been a bit of a rebel, you
know.”
</p><!--l. 22813--><p class="indent" >  Preeta said, Preeta said. What was he thinking? He had been absorbed by his work
for almost a full day, but the suggestion arrested his thoughts abruptly. It touched a
primal contact within him, unleashing a spark of arousal. It would be good for him to
get out and see people in a social situation. His heart beat suddenly to the rhythm of a
diﬀerent drum.
</p><!--l. 22820--><p class="indent" >  Dermot seemed to glide down the corridor without feeling his feet touch the
ground. He could have been ﬂoating or levitating from the attention; if he were only
attached to reality at all he might have realized that all he was missing was the very
cause of his elation. But he was feeling good, on a cloud, and every worldly tether
seemed beyond him at that moment. Break free—burn the candle at both ends.
Progress.
</p><!--l. 22828--><p class="indent" >  But now his nerve is shaken. After work activity is not common here. People are
usually just glad to get home at the end of a day. <span

amongst a few shops which nest in the ground ﬂoors of the four-story ﬂats: the
restaurant is really not that far from the police building. Dermot observes a pub
next door ﬁlled with long and ﬂamboyant leather coats, and black dyed hair,
boots and metallic studs. It is a room that seems removed from the rest of this
Asian area, like a puzzle to be solved, but he is not in the game now. It must
be a real meeting place for these black haired denizens. He begins to feel
daring.
</p><!--l. 22844--><p class="indent" >  Little Saigon. The restaurant is not very James Bond. There are no glamorous
dresses and shirt-tails, no roulette tables and exotic bars. The brown Formica tables
and orange plastic seats belong to a diﬀerent stratum and age, but the food is tasty.
Garlic and chilli, wrapped in plastic, peanuts and mint, crunch inside his mouth. Small
candles ﬂicker in appreciation of their custom.

</p><!--l. 22854--><p class="indent" >  “You want a beer Preeta?”
</p><!--l. 22856--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ve never tried beer before”.
</p><!--l. 22858--><p class="indent" >  “Really?”
</p><!--l. 22860--><p class="indent" >  She shrugs. “Okay, I&#x2019;ll try a small one.”
</p><!--l. 22862--><p class="indent" >  Preeta and Dermot.

</p><!--l. 22864--><p class="indent" >  World-lines crossed.
</p><!--l. 22866--><p class="indent" >  She does not know all the faces at the table, but as she drinks the strangely sour
liquid, with her food, the unfamiliarity seems to matter less.
</p><!--l. 22870--><p class="indent" >  She feels important: a meal in her honour.
</p><!--l. 22872--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I am not dead here.</span>
</p><!--l. 22874--><p class="indent" >  “So welcome to our country,” one of the group announces, raising his glass..
Unknown face. A friend of Jonathan. “The land of taxidermy and taxes plenty.
Skål!”
</p><!--l. 22878--><p class="indent" >  “What do you make of our crime team? All the little students and boﬃns?”
</p><!--l. 22881--><p class="indent" >  “Everyone seems very nice.”
</p><!--l. 22883--><p class="indent" >  “She&#x2019;s too polite!”
</p><!--l. 22885--><p class="indent" >  “Prima, no, what&#x2019;s your name?”
</p><!--l. 22887--><p class="indent" >  “Preeta.”
</p><!--l. 22889--><p class="indent" >  ”We heard you are a wiz with the diagnostics.”
</p><!--l. 22891--><p class="indent" >  “I have had lots of practice,” she tells them modestly.
</p><!--l. 22893--><p class="indent" >  “So is it true that you have to work twice as many hours in Malaysia?”
</p><!--l. 22895--><p class="indent" >  She smiles. “Not yet.”
</p><!--l. 22897--><p class="indent" >  “And do they put you in jail if you spit on the ground?”
</p><!--l. 22899--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s Singapore, idiot!”
</p><!--l. 22901--><p class="indent" >  “Not even a whipping?”
</p><!--l. 22903--><p class="indent" >  “Well, that must make it the opposite of here.” Ivar. “Here we spit all the time and
work half the time.”
</p><!--l. 22906--><p class="indent" >  “No one gets anything done here,” Dermot mutters. “We don&#x2019;t put in the hours. Too
much free time and vacation.”
</p><!--l. 22909--><p class="indent" >  “Look who&#x2019;s talking! When was your last vacation, Dermot?”
</p><!--l. 22911--><p class="indent" >  He squirms. “Not for a while.”
</p><!--l. 22913--><p class="indent" >  “This man works two jobs. You need a life, my man.”
</p><!--l. 22915--><p class="indent" >  “I have a life, thanks,” he replies with a trace of anger.
</p><!--l. 22918--><p class="indent" >  Preeta sips her beer and feels a creeping numbness, almost like a pain that does not
hurt, somewhere in her brain. The world is simpler; details do not seem to matter as
much. It is as though something has clasped her head and she is wearing
it.
</p><!--l. 22923--><p class="indent" >  The boss-lady of the house inspects their table over the top of her glasses
and shouts something in Vietnamese. Anything else for you? Peanuts and
noodles. This is a taste of home, in an unlikely igloo. Location stored for future
reference.
</p><!--l. 22928--><p class="indent" >  Time gets gobbled up like spring-rolls, their infused and weary bodies supported in
the uncomfortable chairs. Dermot goes quiet as usual, and seems to be anxious to go
somewhere else. How long have they been sitting here? It is 23:00 hours and the
conversation is beginning to peter out. Preeta is tingling and she does not want the
evening to end yet.
</p><!--l. 22935--><p class="indent" >  “You know, I should go,” Dermot says.
</p><!--l. 22937--><p class="indent" >  “But we are about to plan our work for the next week,” Jonathan jokes.

</p><!--l. 22939--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah – let me know. Uh – nice to meet you all. Preeta, I guess I&#x2019;ll see you
tomorrow.”
</p><!--l. 22942--><p class="indent" >  “No, you can&#x2019;t go now,” Ivar complains. “Preeta wanted a night out, Look, why
don&#x2019;t we go and have one more drink at this bar just around the corner. By then, we
might be all ﬁnished.”
</p><!--l. 22946--><p class="indent" >  “I am pretty tired.”
</p><!--l. 22948--><p class="indent" >  “Preeta, you&#x2019;ll come with us won&#x2019;t you?”
</p><!--l. 22950--><p class="indent" >  She nods, dizzily. “Yes, I would like that. Dermot, you should come too. Just for a
little while?”
</p><!--l. 22953--><p class="indent" >  He checks his mobile, demonstratively for an excuse to leave. There is
none.
</p><!--l. 22955--><p class="indent" >  Preeta puts a hand on his shoulder and tugs at his jacket. “Just for a little
while?”
</p><!--l. 22957--><p class="indent" >  He squeaks inside. And what if he doesn&#x2019;t come? Will she go home with one of
the others? Will he have missed an opportunity? No, he cannot think like
that.
</p><!--l. 22961--><p class="indent" >  “Come on, Derm! Come with us for another half-litre.”
</p><!--l. 22963--><p class="indent" >  Trapped. He nods, “Okay,” and is rewarded by Preeta&#x2019;s broad smile.

<!--l. 22969--><p class="indent" >  They walk back out into the cold night, sounds of drunken shouting and distant,
swooshing cars. Just a few blocks towards Young&#x2019;s Square and then slip into a bar. It
is a dimly lit place, with small tea-candles ﬂickering at the tables. The bar
itself is brightly lit: row upon row of coloured bottles, with luminous and
animated labels line the shelves at the bar. Colours, shapes and sizes. Each label
is trying to attract attention with its kaleidoscopic antics. Which of these
appeals to you most? Some of the drinks can even change colour, or is it the
bottles?
</p><!--l. 22978--><p class="indent" >  They occupy a table in the shifting half-spaces.
</p><!--l. 22980--><p class="indent" >  “We have to go up to the bar to get drinks here. I&#x2019;ll go ﬁrst,” Jonathan
informs.
</p><!--l. 22983--><p class="indent" >  Unfathomable sound: it is a cacophony of fragmented voices, coming from
everywhere at once, like a ﬂock of squawking birds. It reverberates around every
corner of the establishment, devolving into a ﬂat mixture of meaningless jabber. Too
much information is simply noise. Superposed onto this nocturnal aviary is music,
which beats out a simple pulsing rhythm, something to focus on if not to listen to. It
is like a string of buoys on the ocean, or a ladder up the smooth side of a
skyscraper; it is a crutch for gaining purchase on the otherwise featureless
audio.

</p><!--l. 22993--><p class="indent" >  “Oh my god,” Ivar chants.
</p><!--l. 22995--><p class="indent" >  It is amazing that a single voice can be heard over this din, truly a testament to the
power of the human brain to focus on a single message when shrouded in static. This
is Bishop&#x2019;s doctrine in action, Dermot thinks.
</p><!--l. 22999--><p class="indent" >  “Have you seen that skirt?”
</p><!--l. 23001--><p class="indent" >  Their attention is drawn to a pair of black legs, terminated in the merest slip of a
loin-cloth.
</p><!--l. 23004--><p class="indent" >  “Now that&#x2019;s how you get someone&#x2019;s attention.”
</p><!--l. 23006--><p class="indent" >  They laugh, though the sound is laced with a nervous strain.
</p><!--l. 23008--><p class="indent" >  “She&#x2019;s beautiful,” she mouths.
</p><!--l. 23010--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s probably been patented.”
</p><!--l. 23012--><p class="indent" >  “Take a picture and send it to Bishop. This could be the start of a whole new theory
of grabbing attention. If we equipped all the WPCs with this equipment, it would
bring power back into the hands of the law. No one would be able to say no to
them.”
</p><!--l. 23017--><p class="indent" >  “No kidding.”
</p><!--l. 23019--><p class="indent" >  Small groups of mainly male or of female friends, are scattered around. They are
not exotically dressed, at least not most of them. Jeans and sweaters. It is low-key,
informal. Preeta sees football colours and shirts on one table, making a noise. She can
see a few couples, but this does not seem to be the place for romantic encounters.
The women seem to oﬀer one another vacuous hugs and air kisses as they
meet.
</p><!--l. 23027--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s like the girl in the honeypot,” Preetha says.
</p><!--l. 23029--><p class="indent" >  Dermot glances at her, with a barely posed curiosity.
</p><!--l. 23031--><p class="indent" >  “One of her tricks for getting attention. Sexy clothes that promise more than they
reveal.”
</p><!--l. 23034--><p class="indent" >  “Right,” Ivar chimes.
</p><!--l. 23036--><p class="indent" >  “Hey, do you remember that woman, a witness in a robbery case last year. She
took like seventy megabytes of pictures and sound in the name of fashion or
something.”
</p><!--l. 23039--><p class="indent" >  “Fashion?”
</p><!--l. 23041--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah. Apparently she thought this woman, in front of her in the shop, was so cool
that she recorded her just walking around. Then suddenly the woman did a runner:
robbed the store.”
</p><!--l. 23045--><p class="indent" >  “People still rob stores?”
</p><!--l. 23047--><p class="indent" >  “Of course they do.”
</p><!--l. 23049--><p class="indent" >  “Not cash: detergent. She stole some expensive detergent, for a cleaning company, I
think it was.”
</p><!--l. 23052--><p class="indent" >  “All right, let&#x2019;s cut out the work talk everyone. This is our night out.”
</p><!--l. 23054--><p class="indent" >  “So is this our ﬁnal destination?”
</p><!--l. 23056--><p class="indent" >  “We probably shouldn&#x2019;t be out too late,” Dermot warns. “There&#x2019;s been a football
match. There might be trouble.”

</p><!--l. 23059--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah, I heard Ullevål lost on their home turf. They are probably breaking up the
pubs on Karl Johan as we speak.”
</p><!--l. 23062--><p class="indent" >  “Who cares?”
</p><!--l. 23064--><p class="indent" >  “Most of the city.”
</p><!--l. 23066--><p class="indent" >  “Perhaps we should ﬁnd more of a dance club, where they are not likely to
go.”
</p><!--l. 23069--><p class="indent" >  “Yes!” Preeta exuberates. “I have heard all about the Kan-Klubs. Can&#x2019;t we go
dancing?”
</p><!--l. 23072--><p class="indent" >  “We don&#x2019;t know how to dance.”
</p><!--l. 23074--><p class="indent" >  “Neither do I,” she says. “But we can watch?”
</p><!--l. 23076--><p class="indent" >  “We can all watch.”
</p><!--l. 23078--><p class="indent" >  “Yes we can, and that skirt is just asking for a picture. I didn&#x2019;t bring a cam. Derm,
do you have one?”
</p><!--l. 23081--><p class="indent" >  He shakes his head.
</p><!--l. 23083--><p class="indent" >  Liar.
</p><!--l. 23085--><p class="indent" >  Preeta peels oﬀ several layers of clothing. The transition from the outdoor
cold to heat of the bar has welled up in a considerable surplus of internal
radiance.
</p><!--l. 23088--><p class="indent" >  “So, you didn&#x2019;t ﬁnish. I&#x2019;m guessing they caught this chick with the detergent.”
</p><!--l. 23090--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah, they did. And the funny thing is, it turns out that she is part of one of these
Christian cults from Sweden.”
</p><!--l. 23094--><p class="indent" >  “A Swedish sex cult!”
</p><!--l. 23096--><p class="indent" >  They wooo in unison.
</p><!--l. 23098--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah, probably. Religion with sexual gratiﬁcation. Then they send the women out
to clean oﬃces and buildings all over the city. It is some sort of turf-war with the
Turks.”
</p><!--l. 23102--><p class="indent" >  Preeta looks around questioningly. “Turks?”
</p><!--l. 23105--><p class="indent" >  “There&#x2019;s a lot of Turkish and Algerian immigrants who work in the cleaning
industry. It&#x2019;s one of our failings in Scandinavia. No one wants to do the dirty jobs, so
we have to get immigrants to do them for us. But some of the Christian groups are
anti-Muslim so they try to squeeze them out of the market.”
</p><!--l. 23111--><p class="indent" >  ”It&#x2019;s sanctioned racism,” Jonathan says, returning from the bar with a couple of
beers.
</p><!--l. 23114--><p class="indent" >  There is a sudden roar of enthusiasm from the table of football supporters.
</p><!--l. 23116--><p class="indent" >  “Hey-ho. Looks like the tribe is about to go hunting.”
</p><!--l. 23118--><p class="indent" >  Dermot looks uncomfortably at the table.
</p><!--l. 23120--><p class="indent" >  “Looks like a bug in your software, Dermot. I think they belong in a diﬀerent
game.”
</p><!--l. 23123--><p class="indent" >  “I wish,”
</p><!--l. 23125--><p class="indent" >  “You could go over and re-program them a little?”
</p><!--l. 23127--><p class="indent" >  “Avatars are easier to understand,” he mumbles and consults his mobile, checking
the state of police reports for good measure.
</p><!--l. 23130--><p class="indent" >  Ivar laughs. “Understatement of the century.”

</p><!--l. 23132--><p class="indent" >  “Have you ever been to the football?”
</p><!--l. 23134--><p class="indent" >  “Sure.”
</p><!--l. 23136--><p class="indent" >  “Really?”
</p><!--l. 23138--><p class="indent" >  He nods.
</p><!--l. 23140--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s what we like about you Dermot. You talk too much!”
</p><!--l. 23142--><p class="indent" >  Preeta: “Stop teasing him.”
</p><!--l. 23144--><p class="indent" >  Dermot looks at her and shakes his head once, sneaking a glance at her as she peels
oﬀ a sweater, leaving only a snugly ﬁtting, white T-shirt hugging her torso. Then he
regrets the discomfort: she is beautiful and exotic, he thinks. The clothes accentuate
that.
</p><!--l. 23149--><p class="indent" >  His mind races at once at the thought of what it might be like . . . No, now he is
getting confused. He is already seeing Christina. Well, who is he kidding? He is not
“seeing” anyone. And Christina is trouble, he knows it, but he is ensnared. What a
mess.
</p><!--l. 23154--><p class="indent" >  He shakes his head as if to clear it.
</p><!--l. 23156--><p class="indent" >  “Are you okay?” Preeta asks, smiling at his involuntary grimace.
</p><!--l. 23158--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m ﬁne, sorry. Just a little tired.” Now pull yourself together, he thinks. Don&#x2019;t
force it. Stop trying to make things happen. It puts people oﬀ.
</p><!--l. 23162--><p class="indent" >  A girl comes to the table, wearing a promotional nano-shirt.
</p><!--l. 23164--><p class="indent" >  “Can I get you folks something from the bar?” she asks. “We have a special
promotion this evening on these items.” She points to her T-shirt, where a picture of
the relevant substances is displayed. “I can get you one of these, or one for each of
you at half-price.”
</p><!--l. 23169--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ll have a beer,” Ivar says ﬂatly.
</p><!--l. 23171--><p class="indent" >  “Regular drinks at the bar,” she sing-songs. “Or shots of any of these drinks at
half-price if more than two of you join in.”
</p><!--l. 23174--><p class="indent" >  “Why not?” Jonathan&#x2019;s friend pipes in. “Something exotic.”
</p><!--l. 23176--><p class="indent" >  “We&#x2019;ll try a shot of the Russian Oil, all &#x2019;round.”
</p><!--l. 23178--><p class="indent" >  She pulls a bottle from a belt on her waist, and produces ﬁve plasticized
shot-glasses of some black potion, apparently from thin air.
</p><!--l. 23181--><p class="indent" >  “Here we are.” She taps on her wristband. “Okay, I&#x2019;m broadcasting on pay and . . .
I&#x2019;m ready for ﬁve responses. One, two. . .”
</p><!--l. 23184--><p class="indent" >  They tap at their mobiles to pay. She thanks them and leaves.
</p><!--l. 23186--><p class="indent" >  “All right, people. Let&#x2019;s make a skål for new police skirts!”
</p><!--l. 23188--><p class="indent" >  “Preeta, you have to down this in one!”
</p><!--l. 23190--><p class="indent" >  Dermot cuts in. “You don&#x2019;t have to.”
</p><!--l. 23192--><p class="indent" >  “Yes you do! Mob rule. Everyone!”
</p><!--l. 23194--><p class="indent" >  They raise their glasses, some more conﬁdently than others, salute and empty.
Dermot sips and Preeta gulps.
</p><!--l. 23197--><p class="indent" >  Preeta sputters and coughs.
</p><!--l. 23199--><p class="indent" >  “Shit, that&#x2019;s disgusting,” Dermot winces.
</p><!--l. 23201--><p class="indent" >  Gasps and grins.
</p><!--l. 23203--><p class="indent" >  “I think I would like something else,” Preeta laughs.

</p><!--l. 23205--><p class="indent" >  “Shall I get you something? I know what you should try. . .”
</p><!--l. 23207--><p class="indent" >  “Give me a minute ﬁrst.” She can already feel the eﬀect of the slug of alcohol
changing something inside her, as though some dragon buried within her is ﬂexing
with its ﬁres. If they are trying to push her into a single role, make her one of them,
like a slave girl, then they are mistaken. That is what she has been running from all her
life.
</p><!--l. 23214--><p class="indent" >  “So is someone going to tell me? What is a Swedish sex cult?” she asks.
</p><!--l. 23216--><p class="indent" >  They look at one another and laugh.
</p><!--l. 23218--><p class="indent" >  “Are you interested?”
</p><!--l. 23220--><p class="indent" >  “How can I know, if you don&#x2019;t tell me about them?”
</p><!--l. 23222--><p class="indent" >  “The sex cults. That&#x2019;s religion with sex and manipulation.”
</p><!--l. 23225--><p class="indent" >  “We have them here too, just for the record.”
</p><!--l. 23227--><p class="indent" >  “Where is the religion in it?”
</p><!--l. 23229--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s ceremonial. Same thing really.”
</p><!--l. 23231--><p class="indent" >  “They are basically Christian Bible bashers, like fundamentalists, but they live in
closed quarters, usually with some kind of conﬁdence trickster nutcase at the
helm.”
</p><!--l. 23235--><p class="indent" >  “He&#x2019;s usually a dictator, and he gets people to cleanse their ﬁlthy sins by having sex
with him, or in groups, or whatever.”
</p><!--l. 23238--><p class="indent" >  “Them and their small son&#x2019;s and daughters.”
</p><!--l. 23240--><p class="indent" >  “And Bishop would like to exterminate them all.”
</p><!--l. 23242--><p class="indent" >  “You shouldn&#x2019;t make fun of Bishop.”
</p><!--l. 23244--><p class="indent" >  “Why not?” Ivar laughs. “The guy is a little over-serious at times.”
</p><!--l. 23246--><p class="indent" >  “You make him sound like the fanatic. This sounds awful.”
</p><!--l. 23248--><p class="indent" >  “Man with a mission.”
</p><!--l. 23250--><p class="indent" >  “Rumour has it that someone in his family got taken in by one of the cults once, but
it&#x2019;s just a rumour.”
</p><!--l. 23253--><p class="indent" >  “We haven&#x2019;t come very far in moving his project forward. Too many other
things to work on to ﬁght something as abstract as ﬁghting a brainwashing
campaign.”
</p><!--l. 23257--><p class="indent" >  Preeta shakes her head imperceptibly.
</p><!--l. 23259--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah, we still don&#x2019;t know how to do it. At least, I can&#x2019;t think of the goddamn
answer.”
</p><!--l. 23262--><p class="indent" >  “What about you, Dermot? How would a game designer seduce someone or
counter-seduce someone from the clutches of the enemy?”
</p><!--l. 23265--><p class="indent" >  Dermot is feeling calmer from the ingestion of alcohol. He risks an answer. “Bishop
tells us that the church is gaining ground, but I have never understood it. People are
selﬁsh today – why would they invest in something like a church, where there is a
congregation you have to take care of, unless it gave them something for free? You
have to believe that people are basically cynical, not that they&#x2019;re saints. I just don&#x2019;t get
it.”
</p><!--l. 23273--><p class="indent" >  “You don&#x2019;t have to understand it,” Jonathan says. “But it&#x2019;s deﬁnitely happening.”

</p><!--l. 23276--><p class="indent" >  “The religions are carving up Africa pretty eﬀectively,” Jonathan&#x2019;s friend chimes.
“Islam in the North and the Evangelicals and Catholics ﬁghting it out in sub-Saharan.
Maybe people feel that it gives them direction or a sense of family, when there is no
sense of safety from government?”
</p><!--l. 23281--><p class="indent" >  “People have extended families in the game. Virtual family has never been more
popular. What do they want with religion in this day and age?”
</p><!--l. 23284--><p class="indent" >  “People want to be looked after. That has to be why presidential ﬁgures are revered,
even when people disapprove of their politics. People actually want someone to stand
up and tell them that everything is all right.”
</p><!--l. 23288--><p class="indent" >  “And that&#x2019;s the point, isn&#x2019;t it? Now it is falling apart. The trust has gone out
of the presidential ﬁgures, so religious ﬁgures see their chance to step in
again..”
</p><!--l. 23292--><p class="indent" >  “The point is that they don&#x2019;t see any beneﬁts from central government, so they live
like mobs and tribes, like in Africa. Then you can have any local zealot as your local
leader, with his own agenda.”
</p><!--l. 23297--><p class="indent" >  Dermot&#x2019;s weariness is starting to fade. He feels that he is beginning to get
the hang of being out. The tiredness is passing. He has caught his second
wind.
</p><!--l. 23301--><p class="indent" >  “Preeta, do you know what you want to drink?”
</p><!--l. 23303--><p class="indent" >  She shakes her head.
</p><!--l. 23305--><p class="indent" >  “There is so much to choose from. I don&#x2019;t know where to start.”
</p><!--l. 23307--><p class="indent" >  “Did you like the beer you had?”
</p><!--l. 23309--><p class="indent" >  She shrugs. “It was interesting.”
</p><!--l. 23311--><p class="indent" >  “Why not try a cocktail?” Jonathan suggests.
</p><!--l. 23313--><p class="indent" >  “All right. I would like a blue drink,” she says.
</p><!--l. 23315--><p class="indent" >  They laugh.
</p><!--l. 23317--><p class="indent" >  “How about a margarita with that blue stuﬀ?” Ivar says.
</p><!--l. 23319--><p class="indent" >  “Will you come with me and tell me what to ask for?”
</p><!--l. 23321--><p class="indent" >  “Ehmm. Have to give me a minute on that.” He runs it up on his mobile and shows
her a picture on a tablet. “This?”
</p><!--l. 23324--><p class="indent" >  Dermot says, “I&#x2019;m going to the bar anyway. Come on, I know what it is.”.
</p><!--l. 23326--><p class="indent" >  The place is ﬁlling up now and there is a crowd at the bar. Preeta feels a body
pressing into hers, She smells the lactic sweat and wafts of pot-encrusted jackets.
Clothes, boring and beautiful. Make-up, scents, body language. Everyone is signalling
and sending their messages, ﬂagging their identity and their hopes, trying to inﬂuence
their surroundings.
</p><!--l. 23333--><p class="indent" >  If they are talking about how to turn people from the church, the answer must
surely lie in this melting pot of signals. The room is literally bursting with
audio-visual button-pushing. Bishop would love this.
</p><!--l. 23337--><p class="indent" >  Dermot&#x2019;s thoughts parallel her own. The noise in the room hinders his thinking.
How do you turn such a mass of noise into something more structured, like a
symphony? That is what everyone is trying to do.

</p><!--l. 23341--><p class="indent" >  Suddenly, from the noise, Preeta hears what she instantly perceives to be a scream.
Turning her head, a space opens up behind where they are standing, and people seem
to simply evaporate from their positions at the speed of sound. A body, a
person, comes tumbling backwards, as if in slow motion, growing in her
ﬁeld of vision, and crashes into the bar beside her, with a man practically on
top of him. Like dogs, like animals. One at the throat of the other. They are
ﬁghting.
</p><!--l. 23349--><p class="indent" >  Preeta feels the thud of the man on the wooden bar. Fists pummel into his face and
his nose spatters blood. Suddenly there are two groups ﬁghting at several locations.
The patrons have scattered to the edges of the room, like Russian Oil expelled by a
detergent.
</p><!--l. 23354--><p class="indent" >  The scene has a sickening presence. It is not like watching a bar-ﬁght in a ﬁlm, with
fake punch noises over-dubbed and balsa-wood furniture that breaks like tissue paper.
The real sound of violence is a hollow smack, as ﬂesh gives way to sudden impact,
followed by the splatter of thin red blood onto the wooden ﬂoorboards, drying in little
craters, which darken to crimson. There is the shattering thunder as furniture and
bodies crash to the wooden ﬂoor. Finally there is the swoosh and thump as
one thug takes a chair and tries to break it over the back of his adversary,
imitating the scenes he has learned from Hollywood Westerns. But, unlike in the
movies, it is not the chair that breaks. The man goes down and does not come
up.
</p><!--l. 23366--><p class="indent" >  In a moment, the ﬁghters have ﬁnished their ambush and have vacated the bar,
leaving moaning and bleeding bodies around them. The panic button has doubtless
been pressed, and police will be on their way. The thugs disappear into the night,
perhaps to pick another ﬁght elsewhere.
</p><!--l. 23372--><p class="indent" >  In the aftermath, the pounding music is suddenly apparent, ridiculously cheery
under the circumstance. All voices have desisted. A space remains, buoyed by the
shock of sudden violence. No one says anything, but two of the bar staﬀ go to see if
the groaning bodies are all right.
</p><!--l. 23378--><p class="indent" >  Preeta is frozen in position, standing up with her hands between her legs, looking
hurt.
</p><!--l. 23381--><p class="indent" >  “Are you okay. Did you wet yourself?”
</p><!--l. 23383--><p class="indent" >  She shakes her head.
</p><!--l. 23385--><p class="indent" >  The police were too far away. They could not come in time to stop this event.
Luckily, this was apparently just between gangs. They are not interested in anyone
else, except perhaps as spectators.
</p><!--l. 23389--><p class="indent" >  “You sure?”
</p><!--l. 23391--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t think I want any more to drink. Let&#x2019;s just get out of here.”
</p><!--l. 23395--><p class="indent" >  They return to their table. As if they needed proof that the gangs are a more
immediate problem. The gang violence has been a distraction lately. Bishop
has been having a lot of discussions with the boys and girls in blue about
it.
</p><!--l. 23400--><p class="indent" >  People diﬀuse away from the walls, still looking at the injured bundles of ﬂesh and

bone, lying broken on the ground, but essentially turning their backs on the incident1
and carrying on with their evening. It is over now. Not their business. Soon it will be
as if nothing has happened.
</p><!--l. 23406--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t get it,” Ivar says. “What it is with these people? What do they get out of
this?”
</p><!--l. 23409--><p class="indent" >  “Animals.”
</p><!--l. 23411--><p class="indent" >  “Football supporters. They don&#x2019;t like losing.”
</p><!--l. 23413--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah, I heard they lost on their home turf.”
</p><!--l. 23415--><p class="indent" >  “I am so sick of these freakin&#x2019; gangs,” Jonathan&#x2019;s friend gasps.
</p><!--l. 23417--><p class="indent" >  “What is a gang anyway? How do you deﬁne it?” Jonathan struts.
</p><!--l. 23419--><p class="indent" >  His friend regards him wearily. “A bunch of people with a funny handshake,
walking demonstratively down the middle of a street?”
</p><!--l. 23423--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s the seventeenth of May!” Ivar laughs, to lighten the mood. “You&#x2019;re thinking
of marching bands!”
</p><!--l. 23426--><p class="indent" >  “Well, if they are not a splinter oﬀ civilized society&#x2019;s block, I don&#x2019;t know a better
way to describe them!”
</p><!--l. 23429--><p class="indent" >  “There are all kinds of gang,” Dermot says simply.
</p><!--l. 23431--><p class="indent" >  Preeta shudders and takes the remainder of her Russian Oil and throws
it back, as the others did, medicinally. Her eyes bulge a little and then she
winces and coughs. Perhaps more of it will help to numb the trembling within
her.
</p><!--l. 23436--><p class="indent" >  “Wooo. Careful, girl. We need you to operate that new software you&#x2019;ve put
together.”
</p><!--l. 23439--><p class="indent" >  Dermot sees her and considers doing the same, but that would not be like
him.
</p><!--l. 23441--><p class="indent" >  “The gangs are happening in Asia too. You have the indoctrination clinics, or
Madrassas that oﬀer free education to young men, turning them into stooges for
Islamic extremism. . .and there are Hindu gangs.”
</p><!--l. 23445--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah, according to TerrorWatch, they actually teach them how to use weapons and
inﬁltrate organizations. . .”
</p><!--l. 23448--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah, I read that too.”
</p><!--l. 23450--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s a familiar equation: fear plus resources equals stupidity.”
</p><!--l. 23452--><p class="indent" >  Preeta does not feel like arguing in their defence. For all she knows, it might be
true.
</p><!--l. 23454--><p class="indent" >  “Preeta, you don&#x2019;t look very well. Are you okay?”
</p><!--l. 23456--><p class="indent" >  “I think we should leave,” Ivar says.
</p><!--l. 23458--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah. Let&#x2019;s get out of here.”
</p><!--l. 23460--><p class="indent" >  They don their clothing and push their way out. Several others have been thinking
the same thing, since the ﬁght.
</p><!--l. 23463--><p class="indent" >  Preeta and Dermot huddle together, as they meet the icy air outside the
bar.
</p><!--l. 23466--><p class="indent" >  “You two look like a sorry pair.”
</p><!--l. 23468--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m just a little tired,” Dermot replies.

</p><!--l. 23470--><p class="indent" >  Oﬀ in the distance, they hear a dirge of male moaning, droning out a vacant melody
èn masse, as if celebrating certain brain-damage. It could only be the sounds of a
post-pregnant football match. It booms out from a bar accompanied by vicious shouts
and guttural roars. Dermot looks unnerved, but Preeta merely feels a distant disgust
through her intoxication. They have seen the transformation from human
male to rabid animal, all for the love of a high-tech pig&#x2019;s bladder with spots
on.
</p><!--l. 23479--><p class="indent" >  “I need to go and dance and feel happy,” Preeta says, giddily.
</p><!--l. 23481--><p class="indent" >  “Do you belly dance? Can I come and watch?” Jonathan&#x2019;s friend. Idiot.
</p><!--l. 23483--><p class="indent" >  “Grow up,” Jonathan says.
</p><!--l. 23485--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t tell him to grow up. He&#x2019;s trying.”
</p><!--l. 23487--><p class="indent" >  Preeta says: “Boys. Be nice. Anyway, for the record, we don&#x2019;t ‘grow up&#x2019;. We get
worn down, we lose our sharp edges.”
</p><!--l. 23490--><p class="indent" >  “Wooo.” They laugh.
</p><!--l. 23492--><p class="indent" >  She points her ﬁnger a little too pointedly. “We make compromises and accept
society&#x2019;s lowest common denominator package of values and . . . ideas because it
saves us the eﬀort of thinking for ourselves.”
</p><!--l. 23496--><p class="indent" >  They exchange signiﬁcant glances.
</p><!--l. 23498--><p class="indent" >  “And on that note,” she slurs. “I want to party. Come on, Dermot.” She sets oﬀ in
the direction of Grensen.
</p><!--l. 23501--><p class="indent" >  Ivar says. “We&#x2019;d better look after those two.” He calls after them. “You two are
important to us, if we are going to get moving on Bishop&#x2019;s counter-campaign.”
</p><!--l. 23505--><p class="indent" >  Preeta on the new software and Dermot with the programming. Better keep a clear
head.
</p><!--l. 23508--><p class="indent" >  “Okay, ﬁrst place we ﬁnd,” Preeta shouts, pointing to a couple of girls walking
together. “Let&#x2019;s follow them.”
</p>

<!--l. 23515--><p class="indent" >  From a line of decorated bodies, through a door bouncer control point, they descend
into the underworld of a club. The stairway leads down past black painted bricks,
spray painted with art and pseudo-graﬃti. Posters are thrown up haphazardly, showing
concerts and bands and coming attractions, overlapping and torn. A thunderous
pumping of bass reaches up to them, as if they are entering a gigantic heart, giddy on
speed.
</p><!--l. 23523--><p class="indent" >  The regular din of voice noise and laughter accompanies it. It is just the two of
them now. Jonathan&#x2019;s friend had other plans, and Ivar was looking tired. Dermot too
looks like a ghost, withdrawn and misplaced in this universe. She can see him looking
around, as if trying to ﬁnd the puzzle that he has to solve to get past this level of the
game.

</p><!--l. 23529--><p class="indent" >  Preeta is sailing, as if on dream auto-pilot. She feels drawn to the sound, to the
warmth. By luck, two bar stools are free. She throws her coat over one and sits there,
Dermot beside her.
</p><!--l. 23534--><p class="indent" >  Dark Gothic phantoms glide around with stylish mobile bracelets and silver wires
used for decoration. Coloured hair and gelled sculpture. Everyone is a painting.
Everyone is a work of art.
</p><!--l. 23538--><p class="indent" >  The art is cold, she decides, not like eastern art. It is chilly and aloof, pretentious.
They are gargoyles, not love elephants. If I were art, I would want to bring people
together, she thinks. This is masculine art. It shoots its message outward and says
‘fuck you&#x2019;. Her art would be more feminine, more inviting and would say ‘tell me
about yourself&#x2019;.
</p><!--l. 23545--><p class="indent" >  The pulsing of the lights, hypnotising, cleansing. Worries are excised. They order a
simple beer and look around them. Dermot tries to say something a few times, but
they have to press their faces close together and shout to be heard over the
music.
</p><!--l. 23550--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">He is sweet</span>, she thinks, <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">but too careful for me</span>.
</p><!--l. 23552--><p class="indent" >  There are no hot men here, but look at the girls. Sexy girls everywhere, with
amazing ﬁgures. She cannot help but gape. Feline bodies, twisting like tornadoes,
hugging an inner volcano in a tight shell; snaking like cobras, living vines. Their
short-cut dresses reveal ribs and breasts, with coloured hair and knee high boots.
Preeta is entranced. It was not like this in the subcontinent, where people are trying to
conceal middle-age obesity with airy tents.
</p><!--l. 23560--><p class="indent" >  She feels the eﬀect of the alcohol. It is a new sensation, like being in a dream.
Perhaps dreaming is like being drunk?
</p><!--l. 23563--><p class="indent" >  There is a dance ﬂoor, raised slightly, a short distance away, behind a cage
wall.
</p><!--l. 23566--><p class="indent" >  The pulsing rhythm seems to activate parts of her brain that her anaesthetised
centres would normally reject as irrational, but the prickling of the alcohol simply
makes it feel comfortable. It is like being in a womb. She feels an urge to
kick.
</p><!--l. 23571--><p class="indent" >  “Do you want to dance?” she shouts.
</p><!--l. 23573--><p class="indent" >  Dermot smiles a no. Is he feeling the same eﬀect?
</p><!--l. 23575--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I am here</span>, she thinks. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I feel free, more free than I have ever felt. </span>She has journeyed
half way around the world to be here. She turned her back on her friends, just like
those people in the bar turned their backs on the victims of violence. She is
transforming from a kind grey moth into a selﬁsh butterﬂy, with colour. But why
should she resist? Why should she care? What is there to lose. Only the string survive.
She has been trodden on all her life. Perhaps the road to happiness is not paved with
good intentions at all. Perhaps you have to push others aside and look after yourself,
because no one else will.
</p><!--l. 23586--><p class="indent" >  The notion spins inside her mind, like a rising cyclone. It seems to buoy her, lift her
out of the dread and the guilt. What is there to feel guilty about? Look around,
there is no guilt in this room. All she can see is a purging of responsibility. A

cleansing of daily stresses. She wants to join in. She too wants to be purged of
guilt.
</p><!--l. 23592--><p class="indent" >  Preeta gathers focus and smiles at Dermot.
</p><!--l. 23594--><p class="indent" >  “Come on,” she says and jumps oﬀ her stool.
</p><!--l. 23596--><p class="indent" >  Dermot shakes his head, shyly. He does not feel the spirit of freedom that courses
through her veins. “Someone has to watch our things.”
</p><!--l. 23599--><p class="indent" >  She shrugs, too far down her path to change gear now.
</p><!--l. 23601--><p class="indent" >  She has arrived. She has seen the enemy and it is only her own inhibition. She
pushes her way through the tightly packed crowd and jumps up onto the dance ﬂoor.
The music is beating and people are swaying and singing. She does not know the
words, but she wants to join in. She dances with hands raised and eyes closed,
allowing the music to infuse her spirit. The movements are instinctive and primal. She
does not care about appearances. Freedom has reached her mind, and freedom is not
about control.
</p><!--l. 23610--><p class="indent" >  As she looks around her, seeing others in the same state of release, she recognizes
the look. The look, the very image that she always wanted to imitate, it is that carefree
look of freedom. It is the face of not caring.
</p><!--l. 23615--><p class="indent" >  Just look at the beauty. The sexy bodies, writhing in their expansiveness, riding on
their buoyancy, having shed their earthly burden. This is where she wants to be right
now.
</p><!--l. 23619--><p class="indent" >  In front of her, in a black dress that clings to her body, with short blonde hair and a
long, pale neck, she recognizes someone. Not their face, but their understanding. The
blond girl grins at her and moves closer. Preeta grins back, happier than she has
ever been, connecting with her chromatic opposite, uniﬁed by erasure of
guilt and worry, worlds from distant galaxies brought together by music and
beer.
</p><!--l. 23626--><p class="indent" >  They dance together, holding out hands to one another. They ripple and move
together, as though they were both spirits yin and yang, lock and key. The girl moves
forward and touches her. They slide together with eyes half closed, and kiss. Not a
short kiss, but a long intense kiss, with tongue. A surge of excitement ﬂoods through
her. How daring, how contraire! How unbelievably cool she is! Every part of her is
aroused.
</p><!--l. 23633--><p class="indent" >  She turns to look back for Dermot. Then she sees the horriﬁed road-kill at the bar,
gaping is disbelief. The madness had carried her away, but why should she
care?
</p><!--l. 23637--><p class="indent" >  Come on, she thinks, this is every boy&#x2019;s dream. Two girls instead of one. She lifts
out her hand in a regal beckoning as she dances as if to invite him into an
unholy trinity, inviting him to share in her adventure, but he is paralysed. This
is way too much. It had taken all his daring to talk to her in the ﬁrst place.
Now the thought of parading in front of the entire club with two gorgeous
women is just too much. She sees him crumble slightly, not quite able to
understand what has happened or how he managed to get into this. Then his
deﬂation turns to discomfort and panic and he turns to ﬂee, to expunge the

dream.
</p><!--l. 23648--><p class="indent" >  She wants to go to him, but the girl in front of her is now pressing in close running
her hands down her back, which seems like an opportunity that is too good to miss.
This is my adventure, she thinks. I can save him later.

</p><!--l. 23667--><p class="indent" >  Imagine a conversation, the ﬁrst words of a language. It begins simply, an embryo
of clear statements: the exchanges of proper names and mutual humilities. Gradually
the babble swells in sophistication, in context and convolution. It matures and
crystallizes with its own grammar—a lattice to support and guide the organic growth
of its ideas.
</p><!--l. 23674--><p class="indent" >  Then, as the rigidity of the lattice begins to feel small, life-giving dialogue
strains against the captivity, ﬂowering in deﬁance of an unwanted and resented
structural conformity. An arms race begins, between the need to express more
elaborate intellectual growth, and the need to package uncertainty in a safe
scaﬀolding.
</p><!--l. 23680--><p class="indent" >  Layers of establishment accrete around the struggling organism, choking it. The
beast collapses under the weight of a cancerous armour-plating. Bureaucracy, once the
friend that supported the spindly shoots of adventure in their growth, has built a
mausoleum for thought and creativity.
</p><!--l. 23686--><p class="indent" >  Rest not in peace, but in perpetual debt to the system: a mortgage of
ever-outstanding yet mediocre reporting, ever queued up to exhaust the conversation,
to stiﬂe its power to innovate. This language, Jonas believes, is the language of
administration.

cannot even make it up the slight incline. He sees a car attempt its start up
and slide back down, sideways into a tree. No sense in trying to make it that
way.

</p><!--l. 23702--><p class="indent" >  Jonas drives south, once again, following the snaking road out beyond the ring road,
from the conference hotel. The road is still slippery, but the adaptive tyres are holding
on to their promise for now.
</p><!--l. 23706--><p class="indent" >  The events of two days ago are still fresh in his mind. He has driven this route
several times now, and it brings back awkward feelings.
</p><!--l. 23709--><p class="indent" >  He dropped Martin oﬀ with his mother, that day, just half an hour before she
ﬁnished work. He told her that they could talk later, no time now, and that he had to
rush oﬀ. She swallowed her anger for the time being, and it felt as though he had
gotten oﬀ lightly.
</p><!--l. 23714--><p class="indent" >  It won&#x2019;t last long. She will remind him of it soon.
</p><!--l. 23716--><p class="indent" >  Something has changed in him since the experience. He has survived one attack on
his life. What about the next one? Surely, feeling ones mortality makes one
stronger.
</p><!--l. 23720--><p class="indent" >  Arriving back at the council oﬃces, after his social seminar cleansing, messages
queued up in the message centre lie in wait for him. He has oﬃcially taken a day&#x2019;s
leave to wind down, but there is no escaping the next step. There lay the memo he was
putting out if his mind. It calmly informed them all that the government had
intervened and placed research back together with church matters, back as it was in
the 1990s. Unlikely bed-fellows, thrust back into an irreligious union by the politics of
fear.
</p><!--l. 23729--><p class="indent" >  He read his messages numbly, absorbing their content without letting them alter his
spirit. What else could one do? Then he returned to the hotel retreat to unwind, in the
pursuit of knowledge.
</p><!--l. 23733--><p class="indent" >  Jonas spent the next days making sense of things, using the social seminar as a base

</p><!--l. 23739--><p class="indent" >  He arrives now at the oﬃces in a new frame of mind. Hostility has gestated within
him. He feels like a soldier resigned to the prospect of battle, intensely aware of
failing to achieve any of his worldly goals. It is surely time to rectify that. But how
does one ﬁght an immovable object? A little civil disobedience?

might have some clout.
</p><!--l. 23753--><p class="indent" >  His intern, John, tells him: “I called a friend in embassy circles and he said that
the American embassy has decided to go on alert due to some threatened
action. The French are protesting at their behaviour and are playing silly
buggers by going oﬀ in a huﬀ. Now riots have started there and in Eindhoven
too.”
</p><!--l. 23759--><p class="indent" >  “This is what happens when governments and politics get involved in knowledge
management.”

</p><!--l. 23762--><p class="indent" >  “Can you try to ﬁnd out what Professor Hart is doing at the moment. Is he in the

into disarray because of this. I have a student who is stranded in the ﬁeld,
and a collaborative project with the space agencies that is already falling
apart without your help. Somehow, I need to ﬁx these things that have been
broken.”

</p><!--l. 23847--><p class="indent" >  He regards him pityingly for several seconds and says: “I&#x2019;m going to send someone
down to advise about the new administrative procedures. It should help you adjust to
the new system. In future it won&#x2019;t be possible to let money disappear into these
non-approved sidelines. We want to make sure that we get the maximum amount out

</p><!--l. 23970--><p class="indent" >  The question is posed with the clear resonance of rhetoric. It reverberates in the
artiﬁcial ambience of the meeting. The words could have been read by a vicar as
the opening of a sermon. In truth, they ring with the irony of an assumed

</p><!--l. 23975--><p class="indent" >  The debate has reached a level of agitation that Jonas has seldom seen in without
actual physical presence. A debate was, of course, inevitable; it has not taken long to
self-organize.
</p><!--l. 23979--><p class="indent" >  In a circular theatre of tense participants; they sit, like the members of a war
council, academics and scientists from Universities, College and industry. Even the
press has come to observe and report on the transcription. They have come to search
for meaning, to blow oﬀ steam and even to talk of strategies for reversing the
perceived damage of the leaked decision. Is it still possible to overturn the
judgement?
</p><!--l. 23986--><p class="indent" >  <span

</p><!--l. 23989--><p class="indent" >  “I think it is clear that intellectuals are people who want to inﬂuence society with
their ideas. They are not just scientists, they are more than that.”
</p><!--l. 23993--><p class="indent" >  “So you are saying that they are more than simply those who have a College
education?”
</p><!--l. 23995--><p class="indent" >  “Of course. Are politicians intellectuals? People in marketing? They inﬂuence
society with their ideas, but we rarely think of their daily ramblings as intellectual..”
</p><!--l. 23999--><p class="indent" >  “Politicians and marketeers are merely the plumbers and carpenters of inﬂuence
mechanics. They are not usually the progenitors of the ideas themselves. Not the ideas
that change science or even society. They do not conform to a level of importance that
warrants the title intellectual.”
</p><!--l. 24004--><p class="indent" >  “But people are arguing that society doesn&#x2019;t need academics. We have burned
ourselves on that stove before. We need people we can use. Professionals and
craftsmen, not puﬀed up thinkers.”
</p><!--l. 24008--><p class="indent" >  “What makes you think that there is any contradiction between the need for
professionals and the need for thinkers?”
</p><!--l. 24011--><p class="indent" >  “Well, look at what happened in the information technology bubble. There was
enormous demand, but no one to step in. There were plenty of graduates but they were
not ready to take on the job. They knew the theory but they didn&#x2019;t know how to get
down and dirty. The same with biotech. We did not master these ﬁelds quickly
because we did not have people who had practical knowledge of the day to day
tasks.”
</p><!--l. 24018--><p class="indent" >  “My academic colleague is correct. We do not need thinkers, we need people who
can implement existing ideas well. Let other countries innovate and make the
mistakes.”
</p><!--l. 24022--><p class="indent" >  “Doesn&#x2019;t our country have a responsibility to innovate, as one of the world&#x2019;s richest
countries?”

</p><!--l. 24025--><p class="indent" >  “Indeed it does. Professionalism,” as if spitting, “It is the scourge of academia. It&#x2019;s a
goddamned virus.”
</p><!--l. 24028--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t think I know what you mean,” another says.
</p><!--l. 24030--><p class="indent" >  “What I mean is that young people used to have a right to an education. Now they
only have a right to a <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">profession</span>. It&#x2019;s not about ideas and independent thought
anymore, it&#x2019;s about training people to behave like good little soldiers.”
</p><!--l. 24035--><p class="indent" >  “Professionalism is ﬁling the sharp edges oﬀ society. It is making everyone into
silent, uncontroversial trained monkeys. Think no evil, do no evil. It is the opposite of
intellectualism.”
</p><!--l. 24039--><p class="indent" >  “I think this may be somewhat overstated. I think some of us do survive. I took on
this job, hoping that I could help to reverse that trend.”
</p><!--l. 24043--><p class="indent" >  “I left my teaching post for a sabbatical, hoping to make a diﬀerence, but there is no
perceived value to intellectualism in the state system. It has been smeared as
something for a slightly unpleasant elite for so long that people have rejected it. All
that matters now is the accumulation of wealth.”
</p><!--l. 24049--><p class="indent" >  “As long as it is no longer about innovation, our task is hopeless. We are just a
political can opener.”
</p><!--l. 24052--><p class="indent" >  “If it is not about innovation, what is it about then?”
</p><!--l. 24054--><p class="indent" >  “Multiplication. It&#x2019;s about making more and more of what you already have. Mass
consumerism. Thou shalt not create, thou shalt produce and consume, and ﬁll out a tax
form at the end of it, but you&#x2019;ll not get any points for inventing something new, and
upsetting the status quo, incurring development costs.”
</p><!--l. 24060--><p class="indent" >  “No, that&#x2019;s not true. We can still get money for new projects.”
</p><!--l. 24062--><p class="indent" >  “Only if we are guaranteed a quick return. Only if we can turn it into a ‘product&#x2019;
straight away.”
</p><!--l. 24065--><p class="indent" >  “We have tried to convince the government leadership before, but they have no
incentive to listen.”
</p><!--l. 24068--><p class="indent" >  “They have their own club. The blinkered ruling elite. The system is corrupt. If you
do not agree with them, they brand you as a trouble-maker. Democracy has perished
in their hands.”
</p><!--l. 24072--><p class="indent" >  “This is supposed to be the knowledge-based society. It has become the ignorance
society – the consumer society. The ministry has seen to that.”
</p><!--l. 24075--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s right. We are not even allowed to teach what we want. We have to
teach what the students think they want, or whatever is politically correct.
How the hell can they know what they need to know when they don&#x2019;t know
anything?”
</p><!--l. 24080--><p class="indent" >  “The whole thing started going pear-shaped when they started focusing on this idea
of better ‘management&#x2019;, where management is supposed to mean competitive
leadership. But the role of management is not commercial dictatorship, it&#x2019;s about
coordination. Management ought to be be a conduit—something that receives and
coordinates the autonomous activities of the specialists under its wing. Not under its
command! A leader is something else entirely.”
</p><!--l. 24088--><p class="indent" >  “The people with the purse strings are just ignorant. It&#x2019;s not their fault.”

</p><!--l. 24091--><p class="indent" >  “That means that we are just playing a game of made-up rules to get money for the
development of society. But we cannot ﬁgure out what we&#x2019;re getting. It&#x2019;s like pulling
the lever on a one-armed bandit in a Casino. Throw the dice and see what comes
out.”
</p><!--l. 24097--><p class="indent" >  “The bureaucrats are burying us. They claim with a straight face that their formalia
are there to keep us on the straight and narrow, you know – to help us along.
Naturally, the eﬀect is the opposite.”
</p><!--l. 24101--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s not that simple. It&#x2019;s the child society. No one trusts academics anymore to
know what they are doing. So they have to put us in straitjackets, with so many strings
attached that we can&#x2019;t even wriggle. We have to <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">apply</span>, in writing, to carry
out every little movement, we make no decisions by ourselves. And every
application has to have ‘milestones&#x2019; and ‘deliverables&#x2019; because non-experts want to
feel as though they have some kind of control over what we are going to be
doing with our time and what they are going to be out of it. It&#x2019;s absolutely
ridiculous.”
</p><!--l. 24111--><p class="indent" >  “If we knew what was going to happen, we wouldn&#x2019;t have to do research. That&#x2019;s the
whole point. They have made a mockery of the whole idea.”

accountability from the ministry. Which calculator are you going to use to add up your
sums? What decisions are you going to make in each week of this year? It&#x2019;s
ridiculous!”
</p><!--l. 24120--><p class="indent" >  “There is no trust anymore. Academia is run like a prison camp.”

</p><!--l. 24128--><p class="indent" >  “If we ﬁnally get permission to lift a ﬁnger, there are reports to be written for every
milestone about what we did. The armour plating is so heavy that the beast does not
walk.”
</p><!--l. 24133--><p class="indent" >  “All this management nonsense. Our lives are just ﬁlled up now with artiﬁcial
goals, by the administrators and the committees and the bureaucrats. So many that we
don&#x2019;t move forward. We never have time to innovate because we are too busy talking
about what we want to do, or should have done.”
</p><!--l. 24139--><p class="indent" >  “Without their bureaucracy, the mystique of the state evaporates.”
</p><!--l. 24142--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s the red queen scenario. You have to run, ever faster, just to stand still.”
</p><!--l. 24145--><p class="indent" >  “Change society from the bottom up. Make them respect intellectuals again, I
say.”
</p><!--l. 24148--><p class="indent" >  “But how long is that going to take?”

we can no longer warm up your factory prepared food in your microwave
oven? If no one remembers how to repair anything, if no one knows how it all
works?”
</p><!--l. 24158--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t joke about it. It&#x2019;s serious. Less and less of tax payers&#x2019; money is going to do

anything other than moving. In computer science, we call it a spin-lock. Busy waiting.
Sit there burning calories going nowhere. The nation would be healthier if we spend

</p><!--l. 24209--><p class="indent" >  “What?”
</p><!--l. 24211--><p class="indent" >  He shrugs. “The maﬁa love all the over-regulation in our society. It gives them new

</p><!--l. 24224--><p class="indent" >  A woman of perhaps ﬁfty, masculine and ferocious, with glasses that she uses as a
weapon, arrives in the wake of the debate. She was born for civil service, Jonas
thinks. She was forged in the ﬁres of mount Doom from the genes a hospital
matron and a ﬁling cabinet. Her intransigence will be both legendary and
immutable. She has come to express her absolute displeasure at the lack of serious
cooperation expressed in an unfortunate debate that was originated within these
walls.
</p><!--l. 24233--><p class="indent" >  “Society can not stop innovating,” Jonas stands fast. “It is a slippery slope. It is

you fall behind. Society will lose the skills it needs to maintain its basic infrastructure.

table, like the mysterious visitor from 2001: A Space Odyssey, ever since she received
it. She packs it into her backpack. She has been staring at it for minutes on
end, without being able to penetrate its secret. A note is attached to the box.
“Sara—don&#x2019;t try to open this until December 12th,” it says. It seems to be
locked, so there must be some reason for the message. She placed it next to her

mirror and tried everything barring telepathy to reveal its mystery. Perhaps
they simply wanted her to have a Christmas present. Maybe it doesn&#x2019;t matter
now.

much stress lately. Too much.
</p><!--l. 24986--><p class="indent" >  She needs to feel calm and complete. She needs her shiny conﬁdence back. Sleep

me?”
</p><!--l. 25021--><p class="indent" >  Bishop follows Jonas as he walks through the sterile lobby of the research council
oﬃces, in the centre of town. He has been waiting there for a few minutes and was
told that Jonas would come out from a meeting in a short time. The secretary pointed
a telling biro at him as he appeared.
</p><!--l. 25027--><p class="indent" >  Reporters have gathered outside the Research Council: headline hunters and
interview hounds. A crowd of them is accreting.
</p><!--l. 25030--><p class="indent" >  Jonas looks wary and tired, but not unreceptive. “Help? What kind of help did you
have in mind?”
</p><!--l. 25033--><p class="indent" >  “I left a message for you. It has to do with your work on autonomous agents and
inﬂuence networks.”
</p><!--l. 25036--><p class="indent" >  Jonas stops and regards the older man.
</p><!--l. 25038--><p class="indent" >  “That was you,” he says thoughtfully.

her?”

her here.”
</p><!--l. 25048--><p class="indent" >  As the words come out, a slim beauty in dark, booted jeans with a broad leather belt
and a short white winter-jacket appears through the main entrance, swishing her hair
to one side. She sees Jonas and strides up to the two men.
</p><!--l. 25053--><p class="indent" >  “Hello,” she says. “What the hell is going on out there?” Then: “Remember
me?”
</p><!--l. 25056--><p class="indent" >  She seems a little thinner and a little tougher than the last time he saw her, but he
responds with an air of pleasant surprise, for someone obviously a little stressed
out.
</p><!--l. 25060--><p class="indent" >  “Sara, speak of the devil.”
</p><!--l. 25062--><p class="indent" >  “And angels appear!” she chastizes with smiling eyes.
</p><!--l. 25064--><p class="indent" >  “I am Ed Bishop,” Ed Bishop adds.
</p><!--l. 25066--><p class="indent" >  “Ah hei, nice to meet you. So you two know each other?”
</p><!--l. 25068--><p class="indent" >  “Ah no, no we don&#x2019;t. Not yet. But now that we are all here, I would very much like
to talk to you both. This is a matter of some importance and I know that it is going to
interest you.”
</p><!--l. 25072--><p class="indent" >  Jonas looks around, as if wondering where they should go. His oﬃce? The
receptionist is waving to him.
</p><!--l. 25075--><p class="indent" >  “Jonas, Kaja is here. . .” she whispers.
</p><!--l. 25077--><p class="indent" >  She points out of the entrance at a ﬁgure in a long coat, paused at the foot of the

</p><!--l. 25084--><p class="indent" >  He casts a worried look at his visitors. “I can&#x2019;t see her now.” Then to the
receptionist: “Tell her I had to go out would you?” He looks panicked. “Please, both
of you, come this way.”
</p><!--l. 25089--><p class="indent" >  He practically pushes them along a corridor, leading to a separate but connected
part of the building.
</p><!--l. 25092--><p class="indent" >  “Come on, this way. I don&#x2019;t want to run into her on the way out.”

</p><!--l. 25103--><p class="indent" >  He shakes his head. “Sorry.”
</p><!--l. 25105--><p class="indent" >  “I think I want to kill someone.”
</p><!--l. 25107--><p class="indent" >  He grunts. “Governments are shutting the door on everyone&#x2019;s future, not just
yours.”
</p><!--l. 25110--><p class="indent" >  “Aren&#x2019;t there laws protecting against this kind of thing?”
</p><!--l. 25112--><p class="indent" >  “Glad you asked,” he winces without further embellishment.
</p><!--l. 25114--><p class="indent" >  He leads them into something of a blind alley within the building; the only way
forward is an emergency exit.
</p><!--l. 25117--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m really sorry for this,” Jonas says. “I have some personal matters that are
taking up my time. We won&#x2019;t have any peace if she ﬁnds us, and we can&#x2019;t
go out front because of the reporters. Let&#x2019;s go out and try to ﬁnd a coﬀee
shop.”
</p><!--l. 25122--><p class="indent" >  They seem agreed. Jonas pushes the ﬁre exit bar and they slip out into bright, grey
daylight.
</p><!--l. 25125--><p class="indent" >  It one of those damp days when sounds travels more eﬃciently than usual,
when cars make more noise and passing aircraft seem almost to be upon you.
Crackling winter tires break up the air making it hard to talk. Not far away from
them, there is an unholy sound of roaring people ﬂocking, from the old Blitz
house.
</p><!--l. 25131--><p class="indent" >  “What&#x2019;s going on there?” Jonas asks.
</p><!--l. 25133--><p class="indent" >  “Youth activists, It think,” Bishop says. “They have organized a some kind of
demonstration. I think it&#x2019;s some commemoration—or commiseration of the old Blitz
house.”
</p><!--l. 25137--><p class="indent" >  “Looked like there were Nazi hecklers throwing things at them when I passed there
a moment ago.”
</p><!--l. 25140--><p class="indent" >  She sees that Jonas looks a little freaked.
</p><!--l. 25142--><p class="indent" >  “We shouldn&#x2019;t go that way.”

</p><!--l. 25145--><p class="indent" >  “They&#x2019;re just people,” Vibe says. “A bit too loud, but they&#x2019;re probably
harmless.”
</p><!--l. 25148--><p class="indent" >  He shudders.
</p><!--l. 25150--><p class="indent" >  “I suppose I&#x2019;m getting too old for this kind of thing.”
</p><!--l. 25152--><p class="indent" >  “People with a cause to unite them,” Bishop mutters. “A mob.”
</p><!--l. 25154--><p class="indent" >  “Yesterday it was Christian Rights on the stands on Karl Johan. Old people
complaining about young people. Plus ça change, eh? Maybe I&#x2019;m turning into one of
them.”
</p><!--l. 25158--><p class="indent" >  “Was there violence?”
</p><!--l. 25160--><p class="indent" >  “No, no. Well, not physical, though I&#x2019;m not convinced their message is any better
than a thump in the face. Small town politics, but there is big money behind it all.
They&#x2019;re probably more dangerous than a few louts. They have ties to established
institutions. They take each other more seriously.”
</p><!--l. 25168--><p class="indent" >  “I heard some gang was coming to get <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">us</span>,” Vibe says to Jonas.
</p><!--l. 25170--><p class="indent" >  Bishop nods. “Tried to get your advisor here. Come on, let&#x2019;s go back up this way.
We can walk through to St Hanshaugen. It shouldn&#x2019;t be too slippery.” He starts oﬀ up
the road that snakes up the hill, passing by blocks of ﬂats built along the
curvilinear road. There are plenty of cars parked on each side to conceal them
from watching eyes, and they can cut in to the many pedestrianized side
streets.
</p><!--l. 25177--><p class="indent" >  Vibe looks at Jonas, intensely. “Really?”
</p><!--l. 25179--><p class="indent" >  He nods. “Really. They never got as far as you. You went away at the right time, but
they probably would have.”
</p><!--l. 25182--><p class="indent" >  “Right now their cronies are busy with a protest rally. You&#x2019;ll be okay for
now.”
</p><!--l. 25186--><p class="indent" >  “So, Mr. Bishop, what is it you do exactly? You still haven&#x2019;t told me.”
</p><!--l. 25188--><p class="indent" >  “Nor me,” Vibe adds.
</p><!--l. 25190--><p class="indent" >  “Yes. This is where it gets diﬃcult to explain. I have an interesting job,” he
procrastinates, slowing his stroll to face them. “Basically you could say that I am
employed to apply the science of control and maintenance to policing our society. I
work for the police force. Interpol.”
</p><!--l. 25196--><p class="indent" >  “Coppers aren&#x2019;t just running around hitting people over the heads with their
truncheons anymore, eh?”
</p><!--l. 25199--><p class="indent" >  “Well, there is still a bit of that too, I&#x2019;m sure.”
</p><!--l. 25201--><p class="indent" >  “Does it pay well? Career prospects?”
</p><!--l. 25203--><p class="indent" >  He laughs at Vibe&#x2019;s odd question. “Not really. International policing has to make its
own money these days. We invest in businesses and currencies and run things like a
charity—donations from interested Samaritans, and so on. You can&#x2019;t ﬁght corruption
in governments if you are on their payroll. So funds are limited. I get a comfortable
amount.”
</p><!--l. 25210--><p class="indent" >  “So you don&#x2019;t work for the Norwegian police?”
</p><!--l. 25212--><p class="indent" >  “We are part of the international branch, but we are formally part of Norwegian
police force, yes.”

</p><!--l. 25215--><p class="indent" >  “And you say you need our help?”
</p><!--l. 25217--><p class="indent" >  He smiles. “Yes. Two diﬀerent reasons, as it happens. Finding people with a science
education isn&#x2019;t all that easy these days. Recruiting people to work for something other
than money is just as hard. You both have expertise that overlaps with our own.” To
Sara, “You have been doing some very interesting things in the VR. Perhaps you have
some friends too. I am not sure about that, but I know at least that you are
involved.”
</p><!--l. 25225--><p class="indent" >  Her eyes widen and she laughs nervously. “What things? What makes you think it
is me?”
</p><!--l. 25228--><p class="indent" >  “Well, mainly because it is my job to know.” He winks.
</p><!--l. 25231--><p class="indent" >  Vibe smiles sweetly.
</p><!--l. 25233--><p class="indent" >  “The bottom line is this,” he says. “Law and order, the world over, is going down
the tubes, largely due to the fact that people no longer see the need to rely on one
another as citizens. That makes it hard for the police forces of the world to function
properly.”
</p><!--l. 25238--><p class="indent" >  “Uh, here it comes.” Vibe gives him a look.
</p><!--l. 25240--><p class="indent" >  “Police forces are struggling against the odds. Something has to be done to
preserve their potency. After the big cuts in resources, in the last decade, police
are no longer really equipped to deal with the rising criminal gang culture.
When vigilante groups start to spring up, then you know the you are in serious
trouble.”
</p><!--l. 25247--><p class="indent" >  “Where&#x2019;s Batman when you need him?”
</p><!--l. 25249--><p class="indent" >  Jonas is following the conversation, but his head is scanning around to see who
might be following them.
</p><!--l. 25252--><p class="indent" >  “We are trying to preserve that potency, partly with the help of governments and
partly in spite of them.”
</p><!--l. 25255--><p class="indent" >  “Are you talking about the game business?” Jonas asks. “It was in the news a while
back. About the American government spreading its message of peace and
capitalism?”
</p><!--l. 25259--><p class="indent" >  Bishop regards him. “That&#x2019;s part of it,” he agrees. “But it&#x2019;s much more complicated
than that. The whole thing is a battleground and our research has shown that the
messages they are trying to convey are complex and intermingled. I&#x2019;d have to explain
some of the background. . .”
</p><!--l. 25265--><p class="indent" >  “Please, go ahead. I&#x2019;m interested. You know I had no idea that the police did
research.”
</p><!--l. 25268--><p class="indent" >  Vibe nods. “Does this have to do with the job you mentioned.”
</p><!--l. 25270--><p class="indent" >  Bishop nods. “All right. Let&#x2019;s see where do we begin?” He points up a side road.
“Let&#x2019;s go up here.” The road is quieter and it is easier to hear him speak. “So, let&#x2019;s say
there are several theories about how to keep society in order. There is the
expression of rules in law, but how to enforce? We can start with rule by <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">fear</span>.
Fear of reprisal, whether it be incarceration or punishment, ﬁnes, torture in a
dictatorship, or the threat of what might happen if people do not behave by law. .
.”

</p><!--l. 25280--><p class="indent" >  “Happy thoughts. Okay, so we have done fear.”
</p><!--l. 25282--><p class="indent" >  “Then there is the dogma of good habits. Prevention.”
</p><!--l. 25284--><p class="indent" >  “If everyone is good, then everyone else sees them being good and wants to join in,
and so the whole world is just hunky dory?”
</p><!--l. 25287--><p class="indent" >  “Exactly.”
</p><!--l. 25289--><p class="indent" >  “What else?”
</p><!--l. 25291--><p class="indent" >  “Well, now we have to decide if we have democratic law or edict from an authority,
like a church.”
</p><!--l. 25294--><p class="indent" >  “Which you are going to tell us is an oxymoron, because no one can agree
on what is right and wrong.” Vibe kicks herself internally for involuntary
huﬃness.
</p><!--l. 25298--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Grow up, girl. Just relax.</span>
</p><!--l. 25300--><p class="indent" >  She ﬁnds herself wishing that she were sitting somewhere working on
her thesis, programming or doing something where she did not feel out of
place.
</p><!--l. 25303--><p class="indent" >  “No, no one ever agrees. The point is not that everyone in a democracy has to agree.
A suﬃcient majority has to agree, but what&#x2019;s more important then is that the
remainder of society has to accept defeat. They have to sacriﬁce their ideals for the
sake of the whole system. It is a trade oﬀ and the result does not necessarily have to be
benign. It just has to be agreed.”
</p><!--l. 25310--><p class="indent" >  “So that&#x2019;s the catch?”
</p><!--l. 25312--><p class="indent" >  “The catch is that people do not accept defeat anymore, because they can pretty
much do as they please. We all have the tools and the means to do essentially as we
like today. That makes it very diﬃcult to maintain the traditional institutions of
government. It makes it hard to police rules that are openly considered irrelevant by a
population without a sense of civic duty.”
</p><!--l. 25319--><p class="indent" >  Jonas is nodding. “Money pulls the strings these days,” he says. “It has nothing to
do with democracy. You just need money. The only voting democracy we have is in
kids&#x2019; mobile polls and pop contests.”
</p><!--l. 25324--><p class="indent" >  “Some people have said that the real threat is global capitalism. That is the West&#x2019;s
form of terrorism. It&#x2019;s not terrorism, of course, but it is a kind of a virus against
democracy, in the real sense.”
</p><!--l. 25328--><p class="indent" >  “Apes used to groom one another and that is how a clan was bound. Now we
exchange money. It&#x2019;s just virtual grooming. Little gluons that bind society
together.”
</p><!--l. 25332--><p class="indent" >  Jonas seems to be enjoying this peculiarly abstract discussion. Vibe thinks it is all
just a bit odd, here in the middle of town.
</p><!--l. 25335--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Hello! I&#x2019;m here. . .</span>.
</p><!--l. 25337--><p class="indent" >  “Nature abhors democracy,” Bishop adds. “It is ineﬃcient — except in very special
conditions.”
</p><!--l. 25340--><p class="indent" >  “So I don&#x2019;t get it. Where is this going?” Vibe says, silencing incoming on her
mobile. “Where do we come into this?”
</p><!--l. 25343--><p class="indent" >  “You know about controlling the behaviour of autonomous agents.”

</p><!--l. 25345--><p class="indent" >  “Robots, maybe. . . Come on, let&#x2019;s go up here.”
</p><!--l. 25347--><p class="indent" >  Jonas leads them into an avenue that rises even more steeply through the residential
functionalism, towards some shops.
</p><!--l. 25350--><p class="indent" >  Bishop stops for a moment, panting at the exertion of walking up the steep
incline.
</p><!--l. 25353--><p class="indent" >  “There are basic principles . . . involved . . . that can be transferred. And besides. .
.we are also using robots: virtual robots . . . in game playing.”
</p><!--l. 25356--><p class="indent" >  “What for?”
</p><!--l. 25358--><p class="indent" >  He takes several breaths. “For encouraging people . . . to obey the law, . . . and have
a sense . . . of civic duty.”
</p><!--l. 25361--><p class="indent" >  “People can be bought or manipulated.”
</p><!--l. 25364--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, they can. We can. Or you can brainwash them.”
</p><!--l. 25366--><p class="indent" >  “<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Brainwash them?</span>” Vibe&#x2019;s exclamation seems to be suggesting that they have lost
their marbles completely.
</p><!--l. 25369--><p class="indent" >  “If you can make everyone agree by brain-washing them from an early enough age,
how can you say that it is wrong? How do you know that you are not already
brainwashed? Maybe its a good thing. You have agreement, after all. And it&#x2019;s a legal
game move in the democratic process.”
</p><!--l. 25375--><p class="indent" >  “But that&#x2019;s manipulation.”
</p><!--l. 25377--><p class="indent" >  He nods. “Sure. Point to a country or society where this has not happened. What
society does not preach some form of moral righteousness? Do you mind if we stop
here a moment?”
</p><!--l. 25381--><p class="indent" >  She shrugs.
</p><!--l. 25383--><p class="indent" >  Jonas adds: “Politics used to assume individual maturity and deal with objective
issues of society&#x2019;s development and the governance of popular intellect. Now it is full
steam ahead in talking directly to people&#x2019;s emotional brains, manipulating their
subjective beliefs and views of the world. It&#x2019;s telling us how to think and
feel.”
</p><!--l. 25389--><p class="indent" >  “And that mollycoddling is needed precisely because we are all getting more
selﬁsh.”
</p><!--l. 25392--><p class="indent" >  “You address individual subjectivity because people are no longer a uniform ideal
gas. It has to be personal, or they don&#x2019;t care.”
</p><!--l. 25395--><p class="indent" >  They pause to catch their breath. Sara texts a message to someone furiously and
refocuses. She is not fully certain that she understands what she is doing here. Jonas
does not seem disturbed or surprised by the conversation, rather he seems distant, as if
thinking about something else.
</p><!--l. 25401--><p class="indent" >  “So,” Bishop concludes, as if turning a page, after his moment. “All of this brings
us to the virtual reality games. They have become the new battleground for
indoctrination. It&#x2019;s about the competition of doctrines in a group: who is most eﬃcient
at tapping into people&#x2019;s instincts and needs.”
</p><!--l. 25407--><p class="indent" >  “The survival of the ﬁttest doctrine?”
</p><!--l. 25409--><p class="indent" >  “Partly. Well. There are many degrees of freedom here. Money plays a role
too—social currency. I shouldn&#x2019;t get these things muddled.”

</p><!--l. 25412--><p class="indent" >  “The survival of the richest.”
</p><!--l. 25414--><p class="indent" >  “For an idea or a doctrine to take hold, it just has to be robust and sustainable
amongst the forces and processes that move society. It does not have to be right or
wrong, it only needs to have support in the processes of the day. That is why we are
able to pass laws about all kinds of things that seem immoral.”
</p><!--l. 25420--><p class="indent" >  Jonas nods. “Like patenting genes. Drug companies have the power, using the
money they command, to distort the balance of opinion in their favour by paying for
huge indoctrination campaigns.”
</p><!--l. 25424--><p class="indent" >  “This has become par for the course,” Bishop agrees. “There is no one who is not
using these techniques today. Not even us.”
</p><!--l. 25427--><p class="indent" >  Bishop talks directly to Vibe. “I have been looking you up. Do you know how rare
it is to ﬁnd someone with an education like yours? Someone close by who has actually
studied similar problems? You could be invaluable to us, with your knowledge of the
techniques. Imagine applying your knowledge to social engineering instead of
robotics.”
</p><!--l. 25433--><p class="indent" >  Sara is not sure whether she feels a little taller, because he clearly respects her, or a
little freaked out, because he is a weirdo who has her in his sights.
</p><!--l. 25437--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m . . . ﬂattened,” she says.
</p><!--l. 25439--><p class="indent" >  They continue on up the hill to the small shopping street, and pause at the
crossroads. With busses thundering past, the conversation falls to Jonas and Bishop.
Cannot really hear what they are saying. She is left to mull over the idea of working
with a megalomaniac with a social justice complex, or signing on to social security
and considering prostitution as a career.
</p><!--l. 25446--><p class="indent" >  She feels like a fraud. How could she, of all the unlikely souls, possible do this
job—whatever it is he is even asking her to do. It seems totally weird and more than a
little immoral. After everything that has happened to her in the past couple of weeks,
there must be some simpler option than this?
</p><!--l. 25453--><p class="indent" >  “Let&#x2019;s go in here,” Jonas says, pointing to a coﬀee shop with plenty of
room. “I&#x2019;m going to have to leave pretty soon, I fear. but you should keep on
talking.”
</p><!--l. 25457--><p class="indent" >  They sit around a table and can look one another in the eyes for the ﬁrst time. The
sounds of the road fades into the background.
</p><!--l. 25460--><p class="indent" >  “The more you look at society,” Bishop rants, “the more you realize that it is not
what you think it is.”
</p><!--l. 25463--><p class="indent" >  “Of course,” Jonas agrees, understanding his point, or at least believing that he
does.
</p><!--l. 25466--><p class="indent" >  “We play these elaborate charades that we make up to pretend we are satisﬁed.
They conﬁrm our visions of what is good and right. You remember as a child how you
used to make believe? You pretend to play out scenarios? Well you don&#x2019;t stop as an
adult. You just think you do.”
</p><!--l. 25472--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">What am I doing here?</span>
</p><!--l. 25474--><p class="indent" >  “All right. So civilization is a deception according to you?” Sara drones, in a funk.
“We have society, politics, commerce. Isn&#x2019;t that civilization?” She recalls the game of

civilization and its basic milestones.
</p><!--l. 25479--><p class="indent" >  “Well, it sort of works, so it is not a deception. But only in terms of deeds.”
</p><!--l. 25482--><p class="indent" >  “Hello?”
</p><!--l. 25484--><p class="indent" >  He smiles vaguely, pursing his lips. “Everyone has their own delusions and it
is not just some conspiracy, as some people think. They really believe in
these delusions. That is the point. We are all out there, trying to control the
world, but the world is really controlling us to a far greater extent and we just
fantasize our involvement in it. But then you must have seen all of this in
your ﬁeld? I mean, all of these emergent phenomena in biology are cases in
point.”
</p><!--l. 25493--><p class="indent" >  “Is it worth saving?” Jonas sighs.
</p><!--l. 25495--><p class="indent" >  Vibe cuts in with some searing logic that raises their eyebrows. “If you are a purist,
and society cannot be protected by legitimate, authorized means, then you can make
the argument that it does not deserve to exist. It is doomed to failure. Stability will
surely be lost to competing opportunism.”
</p><!--l. 25501--><p class="indent" >  Bishop laughs in appreciation. “Yes!”
</p><!--l. 25503--><p class="indent" >  “It wobbles.”
</p><!--l. 25505--><p class="indent" >  “It rocks and capsizes! So you need a police force to balance the boat. Mobsters
have become sophisticated now. They are providing all kinds of signals of
their own. Business and religion are in there too, if you care to distinguish
them.”
</p><!--l. 25510--><p class="indent" >  “And for the good news?”
</p><!--l. 25512--><p class="indent" >  “The good news is that all of the money that we were forced into spending on
anti-terrorism measures, to appease the United States, in the early years of
this century, is now proving to be a good investment for helping us with the
gangs.”
</p><!--l. 25517--><p class="indent" >  “Computer tools?”
</p><!--l. 25519--><p class="indent" >  “Information is power. Even the simplest-minded form of gang has a structure that
is based on relationships and interactions. It is all networking. The tools we
have developed to study networks have allowed us to see connections and
important clues that we might never have understood. You have a network model,
tied to a database and then you perform correlations. And then there is the
VR.”
</p><!--l. 25526--><p class="indent" >  “Gaming technology?”
</p><!--l. 25528--><p class="indent" >  “Exactly. They have masted quite diﬀerent skills: they don&#x2019;t analyze the present,
they create the present in incredible detail.”
</p><!--l. 25531--><p class="indent" >  “And people think they can use it to control us?”
</p><!--l. 25533--><p class="indent" >  “We are more gullible than ever before,” Bishop says seriously. “It&#x2019;s no
joke.”
</p><!--l. 25536--><p class="indent" >  Sara nods. “I can go along with that. . .”
</p><!--l. 25538--><p class="indent" >  “You might think it sounds like a bad conspiracy theory, but it is just the day to day
mechanics of marketing, essentially. And it is getting easier. People are not as critical
of what they hear as they used to be. Take the example of you two. The mob, or some

vigilante group, whatever, you see, misunderstood something about your work. They
found a title on the web.”
</p><!--l. 25545--><p class="indent" >  “My old thesis?”
</p><!--l. 25547--><p class="indent" >  “Yes - it has all the right words for an uneducated mind to attract attention. We
believe that they are looking for you because they are trying to master these
techniques for themselves. Lucky for us, people don&#x2019;t understand much of what they
read anymore. We have already apprehended two men who were sent to possibly
kidnap you.”
</p><!--l. 25553--><p class="indent" >  “And who is it you want to inﬂuence, Mr. Bishop?” Jonas asks, entirely
dispassionately.
</p><!--l. 25556--><p class="indent" >  “Everyone. I want to make sure that there is a fair ﬁght in the information, so that
no one can usurp our lives. Some people think that means you have to leave things
alone. But they forget that every living system needs maintenance to keep it looking
good.”
</p><!--l. 25561--><p class="indent" >  A low buzz emanates from Jonas&#x2019;s wrist. “Excuse me,” he says. He gets up and
walks away to speak in private.
</p><!--l. 25564--><p class="indent" >  Bishop mutters on philosophically. “To have a working society, you need to have a
whole chain of self-fortifying things in place. It&#x2019;s so fragile.”
</p><!--l. 25567--><p class="indent" >  Vibe watches Jonas, looking somewhat agitated and feels a little sorry for him.
Something is going on today for him. Perhaps his life is not as cushy as she has
assumed.
</p><!--l. 25571--><p class="indent" >  “So you think it&#x2019;s all breaking up?”
</p><!--l. 25573--><p class="indent" >  “Look around! Who has respect for the law? If people don&#x2019;t basically agree
with the justness of a law, they will not enforce it themselves, and then the
police can&#x2019;t do anything but erode their own authority by trying to enforce
it.”
</p><!--l. 25578--><p class="indent" >  “We take more liberties than before? We&#x2019;re more liberal. Is that the same
thing?”
</p><!--l. 25581--><p class="indent" >  “We have to respect the idea of abstaining from certain behaviours for the good of
others. We have to obey the laws we create. We must respect the people who make
and enforce the law, and they also have to respect it themselves. Even that isn&#x2019;t easy.
We have a huge problem in some areas with police thinking that they are
above the rest of society and that the law basically does not apply to them
– they can park their cars in a no-stopping street. That only leads to other
people imitating their lawlessness and turning tiny transgressions into large
ones.”
</p><!--l. 25593--><p class="indent" >  She nods. “I could tell you a story about rural policing.”
</p><!--l. 25595--><p class="indent" >  “All of this is failing, Sara. Our work is about ﬁghting that reversal by reminding
people of the values that society is based on. It is a new kind of meta-policing if you
like.”
</p><!--l. 25599--><p class="indent" >  Jonas interrupts.
</p><!--l. 25601--><p class="indent" >  “Look, I apologise, but I&#x2019;m going to have to go back. Maybe you can keep me
informed. It sounds as though Sara can help you with what you need. And I am happy

to support this. This is very interesting.”

<!--l. 25609--><p class="indent" >  The café is quiet at this time of day. Oil paintings, dark and brooding, ﬁll the walls
of room, between its large windows; the imagery is somewhere between fascinating
and disturbing.
</p><!--l. 25613--><p class="indent" >  “Who&#x2019;s the artist?” she asks.
</p><!--l. 25615--><p class="indent" >  “Oh.” He laughs absently. “I&#x2019;m not sure.”
</p><!--l. 25617--><p class="indent" >  “These are good. A bit creepy.”
</p><!--l. 25619--><p class="indent" >  “Can I get you something warm to drink?”
</p><!--l. 25621--><p class="indent" >  “Cocoa,” she says.
</p><!--l. 25623--><p class="indent" >  He goes to the counter and comes back some moments later.
</p><!--l. 25625--><p class="indent" >  “So, how was your trip to Jotunheimen. Was it holiday?”
</p><!--l. 25627--><p class="indent" >  She makes an involuntary snort and shakes her head as she sticks her nose into the
cream on top of the cocoa.
</p><!--l. 25630--><p class="indent" >  “It was ﬁeld work for my thesis. But then my project was cancelled by
a bunch of . . . by the changes in priorities.” She makes inverted commas
with her ﬁngers. “So I ﬁnd myself up shit creek without a paddle, pardon my
French.”
</p><!--l. 25635--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I can help you with a job, if I can persuade you.”
</p><!--l. 25637--><p class="indent" >  “I suppose it&#x2019;s better than the alternatives for now.”
</p><!--l. 25639--><p class="indent" >  Bishop studies her. “You are young,” he observes. “I have a group working on this.
They&#x2019;re young too, and I want you to meet them. We are an odd bunch of students and
lost academics, combined with programmers working in the gaming industry and
computer engineers with special skills. I would like to have your help. You could
bridge a communication gap for me, and if you like it, I would like to keep
you.”
</p><!--l. 25647--><p class="indent" >  Vibe smiles.
</p><!--l. 25649--><p class="indent" >  “So how do you get to do all of this stuﬀ? Why doesn&#x2019;t someone stop
you?”
</p><!--l. 25652--><p class="indent" >  “Our main cover is peoples&#x2019; lack of interest in law enforcement as an institution.
The only time they really think about us is when we are interfering in their personal
wishes.”
</p><!--l. 25656--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t know too many people with a respect for the police.”
</p><!--l. 25658--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s a global phenomenon.”
</p><!--l. 25660--><p class="indent" >  “But you have to keep slugging away at it? I guess we&#x2019;d all be pretty eﬀed oﬀ if the
police didn&#x2019;t do their job.”
</p><!--l. 25663--><p class="indent" >  He smiles appreciatively. “The maintenance theorem says that we cannot really
control anything. At best we can fool ourselves by keeping a system in a rough

balance over time. But we are never precisely in control. We only moderate the
balance of change so that it never strays too far from what we want.” He pauses to take
a sip of his cocoa. “This game that people are playing in the VR. It is designed to do
the same. It is huge. It needs to be self-maintaining because it would cost far
too much to run it hands on. There are many automatic systems that tweak
it.”
</p><!--l. 25673--><p class="indent" >  “What&#x2019;s your approach?”
</p><!--l. 25675--><p class="indent" >  “The purpose of the game is to serve the needs of the world&#x2019;s largest trans-global
companies. They are now suﬀering the from the very lack of law and order that their
own ideas have resulted in. There are many ways in which it does that. It is designed
to brainwash people with Western values, to keep them interested in warfare and
aggression, in case America needs to go to war. It&#x2019;s designed to make people respect
the authority of government. It is designed in a framework that makes all of this
manipulation quite possible.”
</p><!--l. 25686--><p class="indent" >  “Captive audience.”
</p><!--l. 25688--><p class="indent" >  “Our approach is to deﬂect other peoples&#x2019; bad messages and to support our own
message of obeying the law and thinking about your neighbour.”
</p><!--l. 25691--><p class="indent" >  “Sounds hard.”
</p><!--l. 25693--><p class="indent" >  “It is, and we have not been very good at it, but now we have a secret weapon, so to
speak. Two, if we count you.”
</p><!--l. 25696--><p class="indent" >  “Me?”
</p><!--l. 25698--><p class="indent" >  “Yes,” he chuckles. “I&#x2019;m sorry to be the one to break the bad news, but you have
fallen into a ﬂytrap. A honey pot. We have been watching your escapades on the game
for some time, learning from you.”
</p><!--l. 25703--><p class="indent" >  “Ehhh.” She laughs without humour. “You mean the back-door my friend showed
me?”
</p><!--l. 25706--><p class="indent" >  “You wish. It&#x2019;s one of the ways that we beneﬁt from the technology built in by the
government for modelling. What you have been doing in our honeypot is to introduce
a very powerful form of countermeasure. It looks like noise, but you are just one
person and you cannot possibly generate the amount of information needed to be
noise. But you have found some kind of pattern that is even more eﬀective than noise
at causing mixing, convection in the system. Instead of allowing it to fall into
its preferred conﬁguration, your activities have been preventing that from
happening.”
</p><!--l. 25717--><p class="indent" >  “My friend and I like to have a little fun with the palm heads.”
</p><!--l. 25719--><p class="indent" >  “Palm heads?”
</p><!--l. 25721--><p class="indent" >  “Gamers whose salutes are stuck on to their foreheads.”
</p><!--l. 25723--><p class="indent" >  Bishop laughs.
</p><!--l. 25725--><p class="indent" >  “You have them dancing to your merry tune.”
</p><!--l. 25727--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Like the pied piper. . .</span>
</p><!--l. 25729--><p class="indent" >  “I suppose it&#x2019;s something I learned from the VeiVeks. If you keep on applying
random strong signals to a diverse mass, you will just keep splitting it up. You&#x2019;ll never
unite them. It&#x2019;s the opposite of what they want. It&#x2019;s like saying to a group of people:

wear this fashion, no wear that fashion! Not everyone will hear all the messages, and
even if they do – not everyone <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">can </span>respond. Too many war cries just create
tension.”
</p><!--l. 25737--><p class="indent" >  “And applied to people, the same thing works.”
</p><!--l. 25739--><p class="indent" >  “People will change, yes, at some individual threshold that you can&#x2019;t really
predict. Just like the VeiVeks. So, if you want to be sure, you have to out-do
each message and you end up with an arms-race. That is not a recipe for
stability.”
</p><!--l. 25744--><p class="indent" >  Bishop nods. “That was my idea too. It&#x2019;s actually better to be hands-oﬀ. Let people
mix into stable masses – ﬁnd equilibrium by themselves. If you keep on tugging,
nothing ever settles down. They go unstable. The conclusion is that you have to makes
them all deaf so they can&#x2019;t listen.”
</p><!--l. 25750--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s not much of a thesis is it?” She feels tired now, and ready to get out of here.
She looks at her mobile as if to underline her impatience. “You mentioned a job,” she
says. “I&#x2019;m not sure what I could do.”
</p><!--l. 25755--><p class="indent" >  “If you can help us with your expertise, I can give you a position at the Police
University to get you a new thesis. You can develop your ideas for a slightly diﬀerent
purpose. ”
</p><!--l. 25759--><p class="indent" >  She looks at him with all the scepticism she can muster. I&#x2019;m a bitch, she thinks. But
why? Reﬂex? What is there to lose?
</p><!--l. 25762--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I can think about it. It seems a bit weird to me.”
</p><!--l. 25764--><p class="indent" >  “Good. So I&#x2019;d better think of my own propaganda campaign for you then.” He
sucks his cheeks for a minute. “If you came to meet the others in the group, I think
you&#x2019;d feel a little more comfortable right away.”
</p><!--l. 25768--><p class="indent" >  “Maybe.”
</p><!--l. 25770--><p class="indent" >  “Chin up!” he laughs. “You know, someone once said: ‘Minds are like parachutes.
They only work when they&#x2019;re open.”
</p><!--l. 25773--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s good,” she says glumly.

</p><!--l. 25781--><p class="indent" >  Cathy Kim is standing in the dry heat of the little ghost town in the Utah desert.
Outwardly, it appears abandoned: cheap hotels with broken doors and smashed toilet
bowls. Inwardly, it has been concealing a terrible secret.
</p><!--l. 25785--><p class="indent" >  The ghosts have been haunting here.
</p><!--l. 25787--><p class="indent" >  Until a few moments ago, this has been a centre of operations for one of
the worst religious fanatic groups. The place was just bursting with illegal
operations.
</p><!--l. 25791--><p class="indent" >  They are in home territory here. Not far away is a little town with only
eight hundred inhabitants but ﬁfty diﬀerent churches. Are they involved in
this?
</p><!--l. 25795--><p class="indent" >  No one was here, no human. But a single computer connected by parabolic antenna
to a network tap, was purring its operational readiness, handling coordinating
activities for lists of operatives.
</p><!--l. 25799--><p class="indent" >  How can so much chaos be so organized?
</p><!--l. 25801--><p class="indent" >  There are explosives here next to bibles. This is nothing more than a terrorist camp.
The blood-red rock of the surrounding desert seems to condone this stockpile of ﬁlth,
as if the blood of the enemy has been congealed into boulders and cliﬀs. There are
professional recruiting agencies operating out of this camp: preying on kids to break
into computer systems, recruiting hackers while persuading them to keep their
virginity. Lists of names and addresses on blocks of embedded memory. This will take
some time to analyze.
</p><!--l. 25811--><p class="indent" >  “Justice is a luxury some people have to ﬁght for.”
</p><!--l. 25814--><p class="indent" >  The baking heat makes her a little dizzy, or is it simply the impact of all
this?
</p><!--l. 25816--><p class="indent" >  She wants to get back into the air-conditioned safety of the car, and have the
oﬃcers take her back to civilization.
</p><!--l. 25819--><p class="indent" >  “You shouldn&#x2019;t be here, Ma&#x2019;am.”
</p><!--l. 25821--><p class="indent" >  Time to make Den deliver her from evil once and for all.

</p><!--l. 25830--><p class="indent" >  “So when are you coming back to the States?” Cathy Kim asks him cordially.
</p><!--l. 25832--><p class="indent" >  “You could come here?” Den deﬂects.
</p><!--l. 25834--><p class="indent" >  She barely shakes her head. “No, they won&#x2019;t let us travel. It is considered too
dangerous these days.”
</p><!--l. 25836--><p class="indent" >  “Well, it will be a while before I can justify actual travel,” he lies. “Too much to do
over here for our mutual friends.”
</p><!--l. 25839--><p class="indent" >  He remembers her tight sensual body and feels aroused, wishing that she
could be there with him at that moment; but in this situation there is also
something about her that seems small and merely self serving. There are
surely larger concerns to think about than his pact with her. Catalin Cortina,
whom Celia has brought to him, makes her seem irrelevant. Moreover, if
she is right, then Cathy is just an agent anyway, using him like the rest of
them.
</p><!--l. 25847--><p class="indent" >  “Heads up,” she says. “There&#x2019;s a storm brewing over the Christian radical groups
here. There&#x2019;s been a police ﬁnd, indicating some kind of activism and corruption. Had
any news from your government friends?”
</p><!--l. 25851--><p class="indent" >  He shakes his head, suppressing his immediate worry. “To be honest, I&#x2019;m a bit
freaked out by the religious overtones and the anti-European sentiment in some of the
material they sent me.”
</p><!--l. 25855--><p class="indent" >  She nods. “Saw that one coming.”
</p><!--l. 25857--><p class="indent" >  “We might have to turn down the job.”
</p><!--l. 25859--><p class="indent" >  “That could mean losing your position within the consortium.”
</p><!--l. 25861--><p class="indent" >  “I know, but the alternative might mean losing my colleagues&#x2019; blessing.”
</p><!--l. 25863--><p class="indent" >  “Your job.”
</p><!--l. 25865--><p class="indent" >  “I can&#x2019;t understand why they would turn on Europe of all places!”
</p><!--l. 25867--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s not all that surprising,” she insinuates.
</p><!--l. 25869--><p class="indent" >  “What do you mean?”
</p><!--l. 25871--><p class="indent" >  “Well, look at it from an American religious perspective. The clash of secular and

religious forces is a point of divergence between Europe and the United States. Here
in U.S., we&#x2019;ve always been a religious country. People don&#x2019;t think twice about it. Even
with the separation of church and state, people embrace religion without
question. This dichotomy is about power, and Europe would not accept a
religious leadership in the same way as Americans would. So, if you are in
favour of Christian power, you have to blame Europe for putting a spanner in
the works: France, Britain, even Catholic Italy and Spain these days. It is
easy to see why Europe&#x2019;s failure to act makes people over here see you as a
threat.”
</p><!--l. 25883--><p class="indent" >  “I hadn&#x2019;t thought about it like that,” he admits. “I thought people were more
concerned with bashing Islam than in beating one another over the head with their
own religion.”
</p><!--l. 25887--><p class="indent" >  “Check. Welcome to politics.”
</p><!--l. 25889--><p class="indent" >  Den nods. He&#x2019;s seen enough of it, now that you mention it. “So, how are you
getting on?” he asks her. “I&#x2019;m still investigating some leads.”
</p><!--l. 25892--><p class="indent" >  She pauses. “Well, I got it covered I guess. Looks like you are a deﬁnitely a
centrally important person in this. But there are others sneaking in from the
sides.”
</p><!--l. 25896--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Some anonymous Spanish beauties. . ., </span>he thinks.
</p><!--l. 25898--><p class="indent" >  Kim seems to toy with something, then decides to share. “And I think I&#x2019;ve
ﬁgured out what might be going on now,” she says. “If we&#x2019;re still helping each
other.”
</p><!--l. 25902--><p class="indent" >  “What?”
</p><!--l. 25904--><p class="indent" >  “Well, between you and me, there was a piece on the information feeds recently
about the ﬁnd out in the Utah desert. They uncovered an operation by Christian
fundamentalists to gain ﬁnancial control over the political parties.”
</p><!--l. 25909--><p class="indent" >  “Financial control?”
</p><!--l. 25911--><p class="indent" >  “Yes. The root of power.”
</p><!--l. 25913--><p class="indent" >  “Both parties or just one?”
</p><!--l. 25915--><p class="indent" >  “Both. You see, they have just one chance to pass a bill through the house
giving the church equal powers to government over the police and armed
forces.”
</p><!--l. 25919--><p class="indent" >  “What? You&#x2019;re . . . That&#x2019;s unbelievable. . .”
</p><!--l. 25921--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s been hushed up, for sure, but it seems quite certain to be put to the house with
partial home voting.”
</p><!--l. 25924--><p class="indent" >  “Meaning what?”
</p><!--l. 25926--><p class="indent" >  “That government and the people get to vote on it, at short notice.”
</p><!--l. 25928--><p class="indent" >  “And you think that&#x2019;s what they want me to help with? I&#x2019;m supposed to hand it to
them on a plate by prep&#x2019;ing people for the choice?”
</p><!--l. 25931--><p class="indent" >  “Sounds like that&#x2019;s the deal. That&#x2019;s what they will pay you for, in the end, if you
deliver. Look at this.” She sends him a picture that seems to have been taken from TV
or perhaps a billboard.

</p><!--l. 25935--><p class="indent" >  He looks at it and frowns in disbelief. Apparently, they have another advertising
consultant working with them too.
</p><!--l. 25938--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Anyone could make a killing with this</span>. At least in terms of money. If they take it, the
company would proﬁt and they would be guaranteed work for a long time to come.
But at what cost? Immortal souls. When advertising gets all kittens and puppies, you
know there is some major evil going on.
</p><!--l. 25944--><p class="indent" >  But, of all the things that ought to be occupying his mind, at this moment, all he
can think about is how he can persuade Ms Cortina that his intentions are
honourable.

stop it.”
</p><!--l. 25957--><p class="indent" >  “So we should centralize our power for the good of the nation – and our allies. But
the ﬁrst step is to get it through here.”
</p><!--l. 25960--><p class="indent" >  He winces at a spot of heart-burn.
</p><!--l. 25962--><p class="indent" >  “Well, senator,” a non-American voice says. “America seems to have been losing its
grip on its people for some time now.”
</p><!--l. 25965--><p class="indent" >  “And that is why we need this game. It could be our most signiﬁcant opportunity to
rein in the Internet for our purposes.”
</p><!--l. 25968--><p class="indent" >  “Demonstrations have been held in several large cities. If this unrest continues we
might have to bring in the military.”
</p><!--l. 25971--><p class="indent" >  “We need to dispel the attention.”
</p><!--l. 25973--><p class="indent" >  “We&#x2019;ll have to move the research departments – move them underground.”
</p><!--l. 25975--><p class="indent" >  “You mean close ranks? That could be dangerous.”
</p><!--l. 25977--><p class="indent" >  “We can trust the intelligence agencies, but who else?”
</p><!--l. 25979--><p class="indent" >  “The control has become too decentralized. It is my opinion that we need to rein in
the pieces under a central control again.”
</p><!--l. 25982--><p class="indent" >  A glum face says, “That is the paradox isn&#x2019;t it?”
</p><!--l. 25984--><p class="indent" >  “What do you mean.”
</p><!--l. 25986--><p class="indent" >  “We had to ask the help of the world, in order to get this done in the ﬁrst place.
Now we&#x2019;re pulling out because we feel that we have lost control.”
</p><!--l. 25990--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s Dubai all over again,” another says.
</p><!--l. 25992--><p class="indent" >  “Well that is what I have been saying all along,” says an exasperated voice. “You
tend to forget that the rest of the world thinks. Not everyone falls under the
banner of your sweet indoctrination programme. Not everyone&#x2019;s kids pledge
allegiance every goddamn day!” An odd look of ﬁerceness seems to come over
him.

</p><!--l. 25999--><p class="indent" >  Dean simply stares back coldly. He has heard this kind of criticism before
from the enemies of America, but never from within his inner circle of allies.
No one has ever dared to say such a thing in a closed session of the Lion&#x2019;s
Den.
</p><!--l. 26004--><p class="indent" >  “If that is what you think, then you cannot possibly help us to meet our ideals.
America will not tolerate dissent. We stand for freedom. If you cannot agree with that,
then you have no place among us.” His arm is hurting now. What is the matter with the
world today?
</p><!--l. 26009--><p class="indent" >  “ ‘Will not tolerate dissent?&#x2019;! ” he laughs. “My god, listen to yourself. Allegiance to
freedom. It is a basic contradiction. Are we really so goddamned brainwashed that we
can&#x2019;t see it?” The man seems to have had a drink or two and will probably regret this
outburst before long, Den thinks.
</p><!--l. 26015--><p class="indent" >  “Sir, you need to get a grip on yourself. This non-cooperative thinking in Europe is
the greatest danger to American policy.”
</p><!--l. 26018--><p class="indent" >  “You assume that the American way is the only way.”
</p><!--l. 26020--><p class="indent" >  “It is our way. This political competition that the E.U. is trying to foster is
self-destructive. It is undesirable and. . .”
</p><!--l. 26023--><p class="indent" >  He stabs: “You mean you might not get your way any more? You might not have
carte blanche, tabula rasa. . .”
</p><!--l. 26026--><p class="indent" >  “America has kept the peace for decades. Our foreign policy is second to
none.”
</p><!--l. 26029--><p class="indent" >  “Are you sure? Is not diversity of opinion our greatest asset?”
</p><!--l. 26031--><p class="indent" >  “Freedom is our greatest asset. That is what we stand for.”
</p><!--l. 26033--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">The senator has fallen for the biggest slogan of them all.</span>
</p><!--l. 26036--><p class="indent" >  “But not democracy. What you talking about is actual dictatorship.”
</p><!--l. 26038--><p class="indent" >  “Leadership, sir. Leadership is a tower: a domineering monument. Democracy,
what is that? It is sprawling ecological compost heap of opinions. The singular voice
of a strong leader will always stand out against the festering swamp of democratic
discussion. With democracy, we have to assume that there is enough gelatine in the
mix to allow it to set as the heat cools oﬀ. Otherwise, you are left with a shapeless
mess. We cannot have turmoil in America, and we cannot let the wishes of other
nations, or morally decrepit individuals inﬂuence our great institutions of church and
commerce.”
</p><!--l. 26048--><p class="indent" >  “The powers of government are being eroded by peoples&#x2019; greed for democracy and
autonomy. We have to show better judgement in the kinds of message we expose
our people to if we are going to preserve this lifestyle that we all take for
granted.”
</p><!--l. 26053--><p class="indent" >  “I am starting to think that America has ﬁnally gone oﬀ the deep end in its
delusions of righteousness. Taking money from the church purse now as
well as its people and accepting its authority. I&#x2019;ve never seen anything like
it.”
</p><!--l. 26058--><p class="indent" >  “The Iranian bonyads? They are like government controlled ‘charities&#x2019; that channel
the wealth of the nation into political causes.”

goddamn mad!”
</p><!--l. 26065--><p class="indent" >  The senator rises. “Sir, you are no longer welcome here. I think you will need to
cool oﬀ for a while.” He beckons to the secret service agents standing nearby. They
move in.
</p><!--l. 26069--><p class="indent" >  The man turns pale and his voice takes on a stammer. “You can&#x2019;t hold me! That&#x2019;s
outrageous! This is a <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">game</span>, senator! Not goddamn nuclear war! Where is your sense
of perspective?”
</p><!--l. 26073--><p class="indent" >  The senator shakes his head. “You are wrong, sir. The future of America may well
be jeopardized. The world needs class systems and it needs superpowers. We cannot
aﬀord to relinquish our hold. We must simply keep it at any cost. That means that our
way is the true way. There is no room for devolution.”
</p><!--l. 26080--><p class="indent" >  He looks out of the window of the meeting room to the lawn and the tree, feeling
suddenly sick, tired and light headed. And his damned arm hurts.
</p><!--l. 26083--><p class="indent" >  “Mr. Morris, are you still there? I just bought twenty acres of rolling countryside
close to a skiing resort, with room to ride horses. Do you know what expenses
landscaping engineers want these days? They can practically smell us coming. I mean
us in the upper echelons of government. They think they can wind us around their
little ﬁngers, and do you know, goddammit, they can!”
</p><!--l. 26091--><p class="indent" >  Damned heart burn. All this excitement, all the eﬀort that has gone into this behind
the scenes. He&#x2019;ll be glad when it is all over.

<!--l. 26103--><p class="indent" >  Den left Catalin Cortina feeling oddly oﬀ balance. Once again, he ﬁnds himself
thrown into uncertainty. He has made the decision to stay in San Sebastian for a few
days, while he thinks about their meeting. In spite of her practical dismissal, he does
not feel yet ready to be written oﬀ.
</p><!--l. 26109--><p class="indent" >  San Sebastian is an agreeable location for thinking. There are bars here where he
can hang out, places to go to enjoy himself and think. He has seen one place where the
women seemed to be just waiting for someone to whisk them oﬀ their feet. But
something was broken in him last night.
</p><!--l. 26115--><p class="indent" >  It was her.
</p><!--l. 26117--><p class="indent" >  She changed him, his view, not merely of his work, but of himself. He thought he
was succeeding in his work; now he feels like a loser.
</p><!--l. 26120--><p class="indent" >  Suddenly, he feels the precariousness of his situation. He is clinging on to his
obligations more by luck than by judgement. It is something like the sensation of
skiing down a black run, in the Alps, at full speed, barely winging it, almost ﬂying oﬀ

into oblivion at each irregularity in the terrain, legs burning and shaking with the
eﬀort of standing up to the barrage of gravitational anomalies. This is not being in
charge.
</p><!--l. 26128--><p class="indent" >  He has to admit that she was good. She is an expert manipulator. She has
transformed his feeling of serendipitous triumph into one of minor unworthiness. She
agreed to see him at his request, but rather than convincing her of his own value, she
has turned the tables on him. He was putty in her hands.

pre-arranged meeting. After a short delay, the others are in place and they regard one
another in the virtual meeting room.

presented to me, which is something we need to hear. I&#x2019;m sending you the sketch
here.”
</p><!--l. 26144--><p class="indent" >  “I brought in a couple of analysts from downstairs,” a familiar voice says.
</p><!--l. 26146--><p class="indent" >  “This is Joost Langendijk and Carol Ann, our American expert.”
</p><!--l. 26149--><p class="indent" >  Kylie interrupts. “Before we start, everyone, news ﬂash! There is a rumour on the
channels that Senator Dean has died of a heart-attack.”
</p><!--l. 26153--><p class="indent" >  “Wow.”
</p><!--l. 26155--><p class="indent" >  “News.”
</p><!--l. 26157--><p class="indent" >  “Doesn&#x2019;t that potentially change the whole matter?”
</p><!--l. 26159--><p class="indent" >  “If that is true, it could mean that the game consortium would be opened
up to public inspection. The house is just waiting for a chance to bypass
him.”
</p><!--l. 26163--><p class="indent" >  “So what about the Senator?”
</p><!--l. 26165--><p class="indent" >  “We need to make sure he&#x2019;s really dead.”
</p><!--l. 26167--><p class="indent" >  “Give me a gun, I&#x2019;ll take care of it,” Kylie says.
</p><!--l. 26170--><p class="indent" >  Den ﬁnds himself conﬂicted. “We should play neutrally for now,” he says. “Until
we can assess what is going on.”
</p><!--l. 26173--><p class="indent" >  “The way to make this work is to let the others do the work. Let them mount their
counter-attack. Let the competitor embarrass themselves or screw up. If they harm
themselves, then we don&#x2019;t have to do it for them.”
</p><!--l. 26177--><p class="indent" >  “Right. With the failing billboards, this is the best approach. If we try to put in more
stuﬀ, it will just self-destruct and no one wins.”
</p><!--l. 26180--><p class="indent" >  “We could release a rumour that we are going to act soon, and provoke them to act
ﬁrst.”
</p><!--l. 26183--><p class="indent" >  “We can move the campaign out of the game.”
</p><!--l. 26185--><p class="indent" >  “Back into the real world? Interesting. . .”
</p><!--l. 26187--><p class="indent" >  “Suppose Interpol were to raid their oﬃces about now, and found some evidence
that allowed them to bring charges?”
</p><!--l. 26190--><p class="indent" >  “That would start a media frenzy just like the one after the Time article.”
</p><!--l. 26192--><p class="indent" >  “It could set them back months or years.”

</p><!--l. 26194--><p class="indent" >  “It would serve two purposes. It would point the ﬁnger back at them and it would
make the forces of law and order look legitimate again.”
</p><!--l. 26197--><p class="indent" >  “Let&#x2019;s put this into a model.”
</p><!--l. 26199--><p class="indent" >  “Eh, boss, we might have to delay on that.”
</p><!--l. 26201--><p class="indent" >  “Why?”
</p><!--l. 26203--><p class="indent" >  “We&#x2019;ve been having a little license trouble with our software. I&#x2019;m not sure what the
problem is.”
</p><!--l. 26206--><p class="indent" >  “Licenses?”
</p><!--l. 26208--><p class="indent" >  He nods.
</p><!--l. 26210--><p class="indent" >  “Well that must be ﬁxable.”
</p><!--l. 26212--><p class="indent" >  “I suppose so. But it takes a little time.”
</p><!--l. 26214--><p class="indent" >  Den groans. “It used to be that you could just use something you bought. How
long?”
</p><!--l. 26216--><p class="indent" >  “They are not licenses any more. They are liabilities.”
</p><!--l. 26218--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t know. I&#x2019;ve applied for renewal.”
</p><!--l. 26220--><p class="indent" >  “Another illegal form of taxation from the corporate empires,” Kylie adds.
</p><!--l. 26223--><p class="indent" >  “Kyl!”
</p><!--l. 26225--><p class="indent" >  Raj&#x2019;s avatar smiles. “At least food isn&#x2019;t licensed yet.”
</p><!--l. 26227--><p class="indent" >  “One step away, my friend. One step away.”
</p><!--l. 26229--><p class="indent" >  “How long?” Den asks.
</p><!--l. 26231--><p class="indent" >  “Let&#x2019;s say a day.”
</p><!--l. 26233--><p class="indent" >  “A day.”
</p><!--l. 26235--><p class="indent" >  ”Hey, guys. Scenario. You buy food for a dinner party and then have to
force each of your guests to pay the same amount that you paid for the food,
because it is licensed to the manufacturer, otherwise the food will not release its
nutrients.”
</p><!--l. 26240--><p class="indent" >  “Might be technically possible,” says Langendijk. “Genetically modiﬁed food that
can&#x2019;t be broken down without a certain enzyme. Then sell the enzyme individually to
generate extra revenue.”
</p><!--l. 26245--><p class="indent" >  They are laughing, while Den is thinking of something else entirely.
</p><!--l. 26247--><p class="indent" >  “All right, let&#x2019;s stick to the point.”
</p><!--l. 26249--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s very funny at all.”
</p><!--l. 26251--><p class="indent" >  “Okay, who wants to ﬂip for food?”
</p><!--l. 26253--><p class="indent" >  “Raj?”
</p><!--l. 26255--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ll go.”
</p><!--l. 26257--><p class="indent" >  “Remember to ﬂip on the way.”
</p><!--l. 26259--><p class="indent" >  “Bring sandwiches and sparkling water. The one in the fancy bottle. We might be
working late!”

</p><!--l. 26329--><p class="indent" >  One has to admit, there is a certain austerity to it all. Someone&#x2019;s hard graft and
industrial ambition yet clings onto the present in these old brick-hulled trading
vessels. They seem like outcast elders of the global village: buildings that cry out their
dereliction and alienation. They can be tolerated, but not revered by the city of
today.
</p><!--l. 26336--><p class="indent" >  Shuttered warehouses, ﬁlled with prosperous memories, disused or adapted to
fringe life: they have all been rejected from the city&#x2019;s mainstream dreams.
The bricks recall a time when buildings were meticulously stacked, piece
by piece, not injection-molded into computer generated spaces. Rows of
individual units worked together here, in harmony, to create a functional and
pleasing pattern. Unfortunately, there is no time for such rituals in the modern
world.
</p><!--l. 26344--><p class="indent" >  But there is no doubt about it: this is construction from an age that tolerated texture
and variety. Every brick does not have to be identical. That is surely appropriate,
under the circumstances. It seems to say something about the city&#x2019;s policy. Where
is this rugged art in the brushed aluminium and glass buildings of today?
Where is the willingness toward cultural diversity, embracing the foibles of
nature&#x2019;s own materials? Where are the open arms embracing society&#x2019;s minor
tributaries?
</p><!--l. 26353--><p class="indent" >  Three ﬁgures descend the incline towards this riverside gallery of twisted past.
Over the rickety wooden bridge that crosses the river, burrowing through
unkempt trees, held in check by wrought iron railings. Rats scuttle near the
water.
</p><!--l. 26358--><p class="indent" >  The arched holes, where windows once were, are now boarded up, mostly. Imagine
the once hot, orange light of industry in these buildings: a crucible of molten iron
lighting up the arches with its promise of wealth and purpose.
</p><!--l. 26363--><p class="indent" >  Today the bricks are painted over, ﬁrst with black, prima facie canvas and
then with luminous pop art eﬃgies. These buildings are ﬁt only for troubled

youths and eccentric artists. This is not the slick polish of commerce and
orthodoxy.
</p><!--l. 26368--><p class="indent" >  Joseph&#x2019;s centre lies in this outcast realm, rehabilitating disenfranchised youth from
their self-imposed rejection. The buildings seem like a ﬁtting place to locate the
centre. Could some of this nobility rub oﬀ on the city&#x2019;s new squatters? The people of
that past were more responsible, more consumed of the necessities of their survival
than in imagined disputes and conﬂicts. This is a place to learn about the meaning of
building one&#x2019;s legacy, and abandoning whimsical destruction born out of the boredom
and absent hope of today.
</p><!--l. 26377--><p class="indent" >  What happened to that age? Where did it go? Should we be glad that no one has to
struggle for their existence anymore?
</p><!--l. 26380--><p class="indent" >  The visitors are wearing the suits of the present. They look out of place
here, Joe thinks. They are church representatives: lawyers. They come with
money in the form of glad tidings. They are coming to buy this centre. They
want to run it, to change it. They have brought their establishment with them.
One can almost taste the sour ﬂaw of reasoning, but that is not his concern.
There are no spires here. This is not where people reach out to God above.
This is where God&#x2019;s agents lurk in the shadows to capture what souls they
can.
</p><!--l. 26390--><p class="indent" >  “Our programme takes the kids who have become caught up in crime,” he will tell
them. “we get kids who have come straight from prison.”
</p><!--l. 26393--><p class="indent" >  “The Get Smart programme seems like a success. We would hope to extend it, to
bring a more Christian message to these kids,” they will reply.
</p><!--l. 26396--><p class="indent" >  Is this what he wants? Is this what these kids need? What they understand is the
currency of violence. Paying back. There is an unwritten rule of the street: people sort
out their own problems. It&#x2019;s tribal.
</p><!--l. 26401--><p class="indent" >  What should he tell them? “The increasing willingness to use weapons to solve any
dispute is their sickness. For a lot of them, their horizons simply don&#x2019;t extend any
further than their own town district. A lot of disputes start just because an outsider
strays into their territory. These kids have been picking up weapons to solve their
problems since they were eleven or twelve.”
</p><!--l. 26409--><p class="indent" >  Erland over there was convicted for grievous bodily harm. The victim was left
permanently brain-damaged for the price of a piece of dope. There is a picture here to
remind him of the consequences of his actions. All for the sake of enhancing his
reputation on the street. Respect, so they say.
</p><!--l. 26415--><p class="indent" >  This has been a place to study modern city tribalism, to learn about it and to
understand its origins. What will it become now? Will they simply try to paint over
the oﬀending surface with evangelical rituals? It might appeal to the aging wealthy
right, but it is no answer to the problem. Just because someone is singing a happy
song, it does not mean that they are well-adjusted.
</p><!--l. 26422--><p class="indent" >  Joe got involved in this programme out of his own conviction about Christian
values. He does not recall the part of the bible where it talks about brainwashing. If
the money they were supposed to get from Jonas was forthcoming, then they could

turn these suits away and carry on as usual.
</p><!--l. 26428--><p class="indent" >  So they come, he thinks, to weed out the diseased element of society, not to heal it.
And it is not merely these violent kids—just go down to the city&#x2019;s edge. There are
plenty of strange, twisted people staggering or riding bikes, bent and distended by
drug-alcohol abuse, looking like nothing that nature would have allowed: is this also
part of what humanity is? Perhaps we are all simply insane in diﬀerent ways,
perversions of nature.
</p><!--l. 26436--><p class="indent" >  Jonas would have said: “You shouldn&#x2019;t even talk of disease. It&#x2019;s opportunism. It&#x2019;s
one organism that says, hey, if you&#x2019;re gonna be stupid, I&#x2019;ll exploit the opportunity,
thank you.”
</p><!--l. 26440--><p class="indent" >  We think in static terms. Change, aging and disease: you are standing still and other
stuﬀ is getting the better of you. A little hedge trimming and weeding is ﬁne, but
killing God&#x2019;s children goes beyond the reason.
</p><!--l. 26445--><p class="indent" >  “Maybe rap is a channel that can reach them,” he hears one of them say, as they
approach the entrance.
</p><!--l. 26449--><p class="indent" >  They arrive at the entrance and step into the simple open room of the old mill,
where Joe is waiting.
</p><!--l. 26452--><p class="indent" >  “Good morning, friend!”.
</p><!--l. 26454--><p class="indent" >  A row of bulging suits, beaming at him like expectant fruit, wearing mildew like a
bad aftershave. They know their trade. Eat &#x2019;em up and spit &#x2019;em out. Infect their
kernels and let them grow into diseased bushes.
</p><!--l. 26459--><p class="indent" >  There was surely a reason why God set the burning bush alight.

<!--l. 26465--><p class="indent" >  On the other side of town, Jonas prostrates his soul before the symphony. The
music is a soundtrack to his troubled consternation, dark and full of the tremors of
gratuitous complaint. The day has ground him down to the point at which escape was
his only option. So here he must lie, resonating with the angst, until it absorbs the
energy from him.
</p><!--l. 26471--><p class="indent" >  A symphonic masterpiece assumes command of its audience, physically and
mentally, he thinks. He has chosen a tragic, wasteland of war-torn desolation to ease
his suﬀering. Its wintery introduction of frigid strings gradually descends
into a tar pit of inescapable, strung gravity. Deep grumbling friction fades
and is replaced by a sudden race of bows hacking rhythmically like axes
clearing a forest. Then, scintillating violins, herded by grave trombones, swell
like portents of a pending revelation. Military snare drums snap him to his
senses and the sardonic tones of the woodwind mock his optimism with their
grey corroded snoring. Life is this rusty pipe – don&#x2019;t expect any more from
it.

</p><!--l. 26483--><p class="indent" >  The music penetrates him, violates his defences, and works its cleansing magic as if
the experience of this tortured symphony is a deeply acting antibiotic for his personal
strife, using up all of his emotions.
</p><!--l. 26488--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Shostakovich knows this</span>, he thinks. He understands pain. It jars from his
music.
</p><!--l. 26491--><p class="indent" >  The eleventh lifts him, shows him pride of stature, then lowers him gently to
confront the hopelessness of his misery. Then just as the thought of continuing seems
impossible a life-giving rain of strings pours over him and washes away the dirt and
decrepitation of those treacherous woodwind vermin. Finally, thundering brass and
percussive artillery shake him to alertness and leave him spent at the climactic tidal
wave of the gong. The blast ﬂings him across the universe leaving him stranded and
alone.
</p><!--l. 26500--><p class="indent" >  For minutes he cannot move or speak. Then he begins to relate once again to the
objects around him: his body, his hands. He breaths and nods. The music is his
conﬁdante. He bears his soul to this music as he could to no mere human. Thank
goodness he has the solitude to enjoy it. Still, the complexity of the symphony is still
mere child&#x2019;s play compared to life itself.
</p><!--l. 26509--><p class="indent" >  He looks about his cocoon of familiarity, at the books that he has collected over the
years. They are familiar and comforting; they are friends.
</p><!--l. 26514--><p class="indent" >  It is not the notes of life&#x2019;s symphony but the spaces in between them that heal him.
His cocoon is a controlled environment in which he can exclude everything that he
does not want. The nourishing familiarity cleanses his frustrations. The friendly
books, old friends that don&#x2019;t answer back, don&#x2019;t complain or demand. His
ﬁlm collection, fantasy to transport him away as a passive spectator. His
music.
</p><!--l. 26522--><p class="indent" >  The doorbell warbles, making him jump up in panic. Jonas collects himself and
goes to pick up the door-phone.
</p><!--l. 26525--><p class="indent" >  “Jonas, it&#x2019;s Joe. Can I come up?”
</p><!--l. 26527--><p class="indent" >  “Joe?” He rubs his tired eyes. “Come in.”

away at other people&#x2019;s business and dirty garbage. “And they were standing there just
waiting to sting at the ﬁrst sign of fear. I fear <span

</p><!--l. 26538--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t know what to say.”

be part of these larger city projects.”

</p><!--l. 26562--><p class="indent" >  “No kidding.”
</p><!--l. 26564--><p class="indent" >  “Thing that worries me is that some of the kids have no hope without us. People
don&#x2019;t take care of their own in these communities anymore. I&#x2019;m afraid of what could
happen when we are not running the centre.”
</p><!--l. 26569--><p class="indent" >  “What?”
</p><!--l. 26571--><p class="indent" >  “The kids are not all that well balanced, Jonas.”
</p><!--l. 26573--><p class="indent" >  “What might they do?”
</p><!--l. 26576--><p class="indent" >  Joe raises his eyebrows and tilts his head slightly.
</p><!--l. 26578--><p class="indent" >  “They come to us sometimes because they feel that they are lost, that no one cares
about them. But other times they have been given an ultimatum that they
cannot handle. They lack the social skills to resolve the crises they make for
themselves.”
</p><!--l. 26582--><p class="indent" >  “And the weak shall inherit the Earth.”
</p><!--l. 26584--><p class="indent" >  “Jonas, if you have never experienced the feeling they have of being utterly trapped
by circumstances—with no possible way out, then you have not contemplated
suicide.”
</p><!--l. 26588--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">In fact, I can relate to that</span>, Jonas thinks.
</p><!--l. 26590--><p class="indent" >  These past days, he has understood, for the ﬁrst time in his life, why someone might
consider it. You are just trundling along in life, mastering your job, making everybody
happy and then suddenly something happens that is utterly dangerous to that stability.
You go into a blind alley that seems like a good move, but you realize that it&#x2019;s a cliﬀ
top. There is no way back without hurting everyone who means something to you, and
there is no way forward because there are immovable obstacles in your way.
Perhaps you are faced with a choice: to kill your lover or your child. How do
you choose? You can&#x2019;t go forward. you can&#x2019;t go back. What other choice
is there but to reset your options and start over? Remove the centre of the
problem.
</p><!--l. 26602--><p class="indent" >  “Violence is often their language. It&#x2019;s a matter of desperation. They either have to
die slowly, where they stand, or jump and get it over with quickly. But if you take your
life, you know it will hurt the people you love and that makes you feel even worse.
Eventually the pain threshold increases to the point where you cannot bear it anymore
and you self-destruct.”
</p><!--l. 26609--><p class="indent" >  It seems like those old ﬁlms from the 60&#x2019;s where people used to talk computers to

</p><!--l. 26618--><p class="indent" >  Where indeed.
</p><!--l. 26620--><p class="indent" >  He thinks of Kaja, the times she calls and asks him to be there for her. And he
usually isn&#x2019;t. Is it by choice that he prioritizes work, or is there a greater
responsibility? Could she understand this at all?
</p><!--l. 26625--><p class="indent" >  Is anything important, if it is not about the two of them?
</p><!--l. 26627--><p class="indent" >  He looks at his pile of old music CDs. One for every bad mood. A pill for every
malady. They seem like old friends.
</p><!--l. 26630--><p class="indent" >  “I have never understood religious communities,” Jonas shakes from his his head.
“It all seems hostile to me. And yet sometimes the rigours of these dogmas have
inspired great beauty, great music.”
</p><!--l. 26635--><p class="indent" >  “The music of Bach, Chopin. . . Discipline is not a bad thing.”
</p><!--l. 26637--><p class="indent" >  “Alfred Schnittke&#x2019;s fourth symphony, a perfect discipline of tonal religious
bureaucracy. Discipline is okay, Unless it is used to suppress creativity.”
</p><!--l. 26641--><p class="indent" >  “Yes.”
</p><!--l. 26643--><p class="indent" >  “Did I tell you? The government has a goon squad now—auditors who check every
action we take. We have no freedom of expression anymore, not in this current
political climate.” They will be sending more of them tomorrow. They do not
need him any more. “Oh, Joe. There are times in our lives when it seems that
disaster just piles on disaster and everything seems beyond repair. Don&#x2019;t you
think?”
</p><!--l. 26650--><p class="indent" >  He frowns into a distant space and then inhales deeply as if recalling something
important. “I have to back out of these project commitments. Did you ever read about
S.O.S.? The organization that runs it?”
</p><!--l. 26655--><p class="indent" >  He recalls some papers in a folder. Jonas shrugs. “Rings a bell. I got sort of
side-tracked.”
</p><!--l. 26658--><p class="indent" >  “Save-Our-Schools. It&#x2019;s run by. . .well, never mind.”
</p><!--l. 26660--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t back out yet. Tell them you might be delayed. I haven&#x2019;t given up thinking
about this yet.”
</p><!--l. 26663--><p class="indent" >  “Is there anything you can do, if the government has already changed its
mind?”
</p><!--l. 26665--><p class="indent" >  “The government is not the people. There are still some advantages to our
predilection for these things.” He taps on his mobile. “Bureaucracy works both ways.
Tar pits might capture the wildlife, but they also stop the predators from reaching
them.”
</p><!--l. 26670--><p class="indent" >  Joe lifts his head, as if he is signalling incongruous pride above his ﬂaring nostrils.
“You gave me an idea, Jonas.”
</p><!--l. 26675--><p class="indent" >  “An idea? You know that&#x2019;s strictly against government policy now?”
</p><!--l. 26677--><p class="indent" >  “There might be hope for us yet.”
</p><!--l. 26679--><p class="indent" >  “Hope?”
</p><!--l. 26681--><p class="indent" >  He nods.
</p><!--l. 26683--><p class="indent" >  “For us.”
</p><!--l. 26685--><p class="indent" >  “For all of us.”

</p><!--l. 26687--><p class="indent" >  Jonas raises his glass. “Hope for us yet.”

</p><!--l. 26744--><p class="indent" >  Vibe and Preeta stare at each other from across the room, for a long instant. She has
heard about Preeta from one of the others, some dribs and drabs. It was <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">she </span>who
located her, who discovered her. Now here she is.
</p><!--l. 26749--><p class="indent" >  Fascination, or is it perhaps a sense of threat, halts them like deer in the headlights.
How will this alter the dynamics of this little group? Who will be the alpha-female
now?
</p><!--l. 26753--><p class="indent" >  Brown and blue eyes meet in space. She believes she see some admiration in the
look, and then the moment passes. Vibe feels that they have looked into one
another&#x2019;s&#x2019; souls and negotiated a stand-oﬀ in that instant. They will be a team, not
adversaries.
</p><!--l. 26758--><p class="indent" >  <span

</p><!--l. 26760--><p class="indent" >  They will talk and share later. Suspicion dissolves into knowing smiles.

</p><!--l. 26763--><p class="indent" >  “Preeta, meet Sara. Sara, meet Preeta.”
</p><!--l. 26765--><p class="indent" >  “Hello, Sara,” she says in an unmistakably Indian accent.
</p><!--l. 26767--><p class="indent" >  “Hi. My friends call me Vibe.”
</p><!--l. 26769--><p class="indent" >  Jonathan pauses, as if sensing something in the exchange and then continues on
relentlessly. Over the next few days, they have to bring her up to speed.
</p><!--l. 26773--><p class="indent" >  “So join in. Preeta is our game analysis guru. The campaign we are addressing is
not just billboards, it is also these characters. We program a virtual character to go out
and hunt down the right people—the right chains of people and command. Dermot
knows this character technology, and you can put it together. Preeta here can
tie the motive circuits into our global net analysis, to better target the right
people.”
</p><!--l. 26781--><p class="indent" >  “Where is Dermot anyway?”
</p><!--l. 26783--><p class="indent" >  “We are a team.”
</p><!--l. 26785--><p class="indent" >  “And where do the billboards come in?”
</p><!--l. 26787--><p class="indent" >  “Eh, billboards change your environment. In a complete campaign, we control
every surface, every aspect of the environment. But we don&#x2019;t have that kind of access
to the game, through Dermot. Billboards are oﬀ limits. They are controlled by
marketing companies.”
</p><!--l. 26792--><p class="indent" >  “The succubus, on the other hand, has a variety of tricks up its sleeve. A basic one
is NLP—Neuro-Linguistic Programming. That&#x2019;s when a character in the game starts
to imitate your own speech patterns to make you feel comfortable. Our expert on
game. . .”
</p><!--l. 26797--><p class="indent" >  “Is not here.”
</p><!--l. 26799--><p class="indent" >  Bishop comes back into the room. “Has anyone seen Dermot?”
</p><!--l. 26801--><p class="indent" >  Puzzled looks.
</p><!--l. 26803--><p class="indent" >  “So,” Vibe asks. “Do you seriously believe that you can inﬂuence peoples&#x2019;
behaviours and change them in any signiﬁcant way?”
</p><!--l. 26806--><p class="indent" >  He nods, distantly as if recalling something personal. “Yes. Yes, I do.”

<!--l. 26814--><p class="indent" >  One could half expect to ﬁnd a threatening message waiting: bag-ransom for
your silence. Vibe ﬁgures that would be taking it too far. The police bitch
wouldn&#x2019;t want to leave any traces that could incriminate herself now would
she?
</p><!--l. 26819--><p class="indent" >  And now, here she is in the heart of police central. She could probably ﬁnd out all
about her and even work a little magic, but the last thing she wants to do is to draw
attention to herself in her ﬁrst few days. There are limits even to her gall. She&#x2019;ll have
her way in due course.

</p><!--l. 26824--><p class="indent" >  “So, the government commissioned the game for a purpose, and now that purpose is
being hijacked by others. Bishop, over there, wants to bring this back to the custodians
of the law. He sees the law courts and the police as being the custodians of civil
society.”
</p><!--l. 26829--><p class="indent" >  “He might be the only human being in the world who sees the pigs as custodians of
anything except corruption and bullying.”
</p><!--l. 26832--><p class="indent" >  “Trust has to start somewhere,” Bishop calls out, indicating that he has sharp
hearing, in spite of his years. “We can&#x2019;t speak for every oﬃcer of the law on this
planet. But we can work within our own sphere and try to make a positive
contribution.”
</p><!--l. 26837--><p class="indent" >  Vibe gulps. Should keep mouth shut. Muﬃns.
</p><!--l. 26839--><p class="indent" >  “The law is taken too much for granted now,” he continues. “That is something we
can change in the long run. For now, we have a speciﬁc race to win.”
</p><!--l. 26843--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">So is it a war on apathy or on crime?</span>
</p><!--l. 26845--><p class="indent" >  “What is power, people? Money and inﬂuence. Money to buy resources, Inﬂuence
to change peoples&#x2019; minds. Religion is a big one today. Politicians can be bought,
especially if they have been programmed in religious schools.”
</p><!--l. 26851--><p class="indent" >  “The Christian schools have their own little arms race going on with the Muslim
Madrassas, to see who can indoctrinate the most.”
</p><!--l. 26854--><p class="indent" >  “ But, if the money is legitimate then we can&#x2019;t stop it from being used.”
</p><!--l. 26857--><p class="indent" >  “Money can buy religion as a weapon too, so it works both ways. Then religion
brings in money, and ﬁnally it all accretes. People are attracted to it because others are
doing it. It&#x2019;s called preferential attachment and it leads to a huge contact network in
little time.”
</p><!--l. 26862--><p class="indent" >  “I know about that,” Vibe says. “Scale free networks. Small worlds.”
</p><!--l. 26864--><p class="indent" >  Bishop walks through the room waving everyone towards the meeting
room.
</p><!--l. 26869--><p class="indent" >  “So we now know there is going to be a public vote, and this is how its going to
work. All the congress has to do is to show that a plausible poll has been carried out.
They then have the necessary contacts to essentially force it down the throat of the
European Union too.”
</p><!--l. 26875--><p class="indent" >  “One way you could do it would be to distract people,” Preeta speculates. “Most
people have some kind of selﬁsh interest that they would rather be feeding. The
central message is only on their radars because it is so strong. But, if you could tap
into those selﬁsh desires, then we can distract and compete with that singular
message.”
</p><!--l. 26881--><p class="indent" >  “Why didn&#x2019;t someone just stop it before it got started?” Vibe wonders.
</p><!--l. 26883--><p class="indent" >  He shrugs and becomes a quiet. “When systems get that complicated, with so many
people involved, they take on a life of their own. No one really understands what the
system does any more. It is too big to see what its really all about. Even if you try to
stop some part, everyone continues doing their job. Each part seems reasonable, even
if the sum of those things is a monster.”
</p><!--l. 26890--><p class="indent" >  “Big is unstoppable.”

</p><!--l. 26892--><p class="indent" >  “The dinosaurs died out.” Sara looks around. “Emily Bronto got too big.”
</p><!--l. 26895--><p class="indent" >  Bishop smiles to himself.
</p><!--l. 26897--><p class="indent" >  “No, she&#x2019;s right” Ivar exclaims with a rare show of enthusiasm. “It&#x2019;s fragile. You
get blown up on some instability to a huge size because you have a lot to eat, and so
you get big. Then once you <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">are </span>big, you <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">have </span>to eat a lot, or you die. You are just
a big vacuum cleaner. If you don&#x2019;t get enough to eat one day, you die out
quickly.”
</p><!--l. 26904--><p class="indent" >  ”An organism is not like a plant that can lose a few branches here and there. Once a
major organ dies, the whole thing falls apart.”
</p><!--l. 26908--><p class="indent" >  “What exactly are we talking about now?”
</p><!--l. 26910--><p class="indent" >  “Growing up and getting fat.”
</p><!--l. 26912--><p class="indent" >  “Wrinkles and ﬂab ﬂaps. Age is a humiliating journey.”
</p><!--l. 26914--><p class="indent" >  “And some carry it with more dignity than others.”
</p><!--l. 26916--><p class="indent" >  “People, can we focus please?” Bishop&#x2019;s weary plea seems to have been issued
once too often, she thinks.
</p><!--l. 26919--><p class="indent" >  “He&#x2019;s saying that we could maybe use the campaign&#x2019;s own size against
it.”
</p><!--l. 26922--><p class="indent" >  “The broken billboards,” Preeta says. “Your wrinkles.”
</p><!--l. 26924--><p class="indent" >  Bishop is rubbing his eyes.
</p><!--l. 26926--><p class="indent" >  “I think we&#x2019;re getting somewhere,” Jonathan comments.
</p><!--l. 26928--><p class="indent" >  Vibe looks around her at the facial tremors and decides that a little self-conﬁdence
is called for. “It&#x2019;s probably doable,” she says.

<!--l. 26937--><p class="indent" >  It&#x2019;s that old tree again: the power of life expunged from it long ago. The remains of
it leer like an angry witch, staggered by years of discord, and petriﬁed here, ﬁngers
and icicle nails jabbing a ﬁnal accusation at its absent assailant. A girl sits on the
ground at its base, leaning against it. Tired shards of bark wither around her in a
solemn benison of extended death. The bark falls as snow and the world turns
white.
</p><!--l. 26945--><p class="indent" >  She stays quietly in the little clearing, surrounded by towering trees, leaden with
their snowy load. It is quiet and crisp, a beautiful night. Even now she cannot fail to
appreciate the quietly beauty, the starry sky and the moonlight shadows of the trees. A
slight breeze is blowing. Slowly it picks up and the pendulous hulks being to sway
in a slow and lofty rhythm. The wind picks up steadily, chilling her to the
bone.
</p><!--l. 26953--><p class="indent" >  Then she has been standing still for too long and her joints are seizing up in the
cold. The trees seem to rise to the call of the wind, swaying in concert back and forth,
back and forth. The shadows create a shimmering eﬀect and the gusting wind shakes

loose a momentary blizzard of snow, blasting it into the clearing, showering her in ﬁne
crystals and cutting through her with an icy blast. Then, as soon as it began, it is over
and all it quiet again. The night is quiet and the wind that rolled oﬀ the mountain is
silent.
</p><!--l. 26962--><p class="indent" >  She moves a few feet forward, crunching the snow with her boots.
</p><!--l. 26964--><p class="indent" >  “Are you coming back in?”
</p><!--l. 26966--><p class="indent" >  She awakens with a start.
</p><!--l. 26970--><p class="indent" >  They are all still working late. She should go home, but it feels like a betrayal. They
are still trying to get in touch with someone called Dermot.
</p><!--l. 26975--><p class="indent" >  “Look at this rally. It is a political rally aimed at getting religious people in contact
with the selﬁsh right-wing parties. And it works a treat. Why do you think that is?”
Ivar is looking at some video.
</p><!--l. 26980--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t get it. How can you claim to be a Christian and support these
anti-immigration, right wing money launderers?”
</p><!--l. 26983--><p class="indent" >  Bishop has gone home. Jonathan likes to take on his role, in loco parentis. “The
whole underlying raison d&#x2019;etre for religion relies on the fact that people want
something out of it. They want protection. Salvation from God. Protection of their
mortal body and immortal soul. If you can get it from a politician in advance, you
don&#x2019;t have to worry too much about your ritual obligations.”
</p><!--l. 26991--><p class="indent" >  “Doesn&#x2019;t sound very Christian.”
</p><!--l. 26993--><p class="indent" >  “No. We are not talking about the genuinely spiritual people in the ﬂock. We are
looking at the habitual church goers: those who go to church to reap some divine
beneﬁt. They are not ideologists, they are the bewildered herd of hangers on. They are
often old age pensioners who are angry and confused by the times they are
living in. They don&#x2019;t follow what is going on. They just want to be looked
after.”
</p><!--l. 27001--><p class="indent" >  “These are the dangerous people. They are the ones that the Christian lobby is
trying to activate. They are spoiled and they feel that they have earned the right to
demand something for themselves. They belong together: the church and the right
wing egotists.”

</p><!--l. 27015--><p class="indent" >  Everyone in the team is too distracted to see the wood for the trees. That means it is
not going to happen without her. Is it really her responsibility? Maybe it doesn&#x2019;t
matter whose responsibility it is.
</p><!--l. 27020--><p class="indent" >  Vibe knows, from the mountain patrols made by her little robots, that damage
begets damage. Once something has fallen into a state of neglect, it will attract further

abuse that compounds its misfortune. People treat stuﬀ with derision if it looks like
it&#x2019;s already been spoiled. So the aim is to pick up the litter as quickly as possible. She
knows this stuﬀ.
</p><!--l. 27027--><p class="indent" >  They can set up a game with inﬂuence agents who create damage and robots that ﬁx
it. The math tells her that she should look in the most connected places in this virtual

</p><!--l. 27032--><p class="indent" >  She sketches the idea to Jonathan, in private.

</p><!--l. 27040--><p class="indent" >  “In a minute. Sara&#x2019;s just about to explain her idea.”
</p><!--l. 27042--><p class="indent" >  “The theory of agent cooperation is quite straightforward. It&#x2019;s all about building
cooperation from free will.”
</p><!--l. 27045--><p class="indent" >  “Oh my god,” Preeta laughs. “Misplaced altruism.”
</p><!--l. 27047--><p class="indent" >  “Okay, here&#x2019;s how it works. We try to induce a cooperative avalanche. To begin
with there is no reason for anyone to help each other out. They might have skills that
they can borrow from one another, but there is nothing that forces them to help each
other or work with coordinated behaviour.”
</p><!--l. 27053--><p class="indent" >  “And you want to use succubi to recruit other succubi.”
</p><!--l. 27055--><p class="indent" >  “Or actual game players.”
</p><!--l. 27057--><p class="indent" >  “Each one will target its own specialist group.”
</p><!--l. 27059--><p class="indent" >  She imagines a naked woman and a man taking her from behind in some game
simulation, saying: “Oh baby, if you vote for them, they will destroy us with their
puritan values. We might never be able to meet like this again!” The man would of
course choose what is most important to him.
</p><!--l. 27064--><p class="indent" >  “What the succubi have to do is to make an agreement. That means there has to be
an incentive, and it means they have to make a contract about what it is they are going
to do. It has to be a two way contract.”
</p><!--l. 27069--><p class="indent" >  “So if enough of these agreements can be made, they start to form a team?”
</p><!--l. 27071--><p class="indent" >  “But a team is not a society. . .”
</p><!--l. 27073--><p class="indent" >  “Well, it is a prototype society. We start with our nomadic hunter gatherers, then
they start to gravitate. They bind to each other together by grooming one another –
forming bonds. You scratch my back, et cetera. One monkey pulls nits out of the other
and they reciprocate and the payoﬀ is access to a nice orgasm at the end of it.
Whatever.”
</p><!--l. 27080--><p class="indent" >  Jonathan coughs.
</p><!--l. 27082--><p class="indent" >  “Of course, all of this grooming is pretty expensive, so after a while they ﬁgure out
the principle of a Trusted Third Party: the leader or god. It is actually cheaper to form
a group by tying yourself to a common point than by tying yourself to everyone else
in the group.”
</p><!--l. 27088--><p class="indent" >  “Self-organizing government?”

</p><!--l. 27090--><p class="indent" >  “Yup. Essentially, they pledge allegiance to a head monkey, or whatever and
in doing so form an implicit group. It&#x2019;s like joining a club. If you&#x2019;re a paid
member, you get the beneﬁts of being a group. There&#x2019;s an implied contract. It&#x2019;s
cheaper than maintaining contact with every single individual. Of course, the
downside is that you then are connected to people you haven&#x2019;t veriﬁed for
yourself.”
</p><!--l. 27097--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s what has happened to the church though right?”
</p><!--l. 27099--><p class="indent" >  “Yes. So we have to build something stronger and then attack their weak
spots.”
</p><!--l. 27103--><p class="indent" >  “Where?”
</p><!--l. 27105--><p class="indent" >  Preeta picks up a pad of paper and a pen and places it in front of them. “Draw him a
picture.”
</p><!--l. 27108--><p class="indent" >  Vibe grins.
</p><!--l. 27111--><p class="indent" >  She smiles at him, feeling smart and useful. “Good thinking, Batgirl. Here. Draw,
say, ten blobs for the diﬀerent agents. Now draw a line between every pair
of blobs. There are nine lines coming out of every blob. That means that
every blob has to behave nicely to nine others who are going to punish it if it
doesn&#x2019;t. If it breaks one of its obligations, it still have eight others to keep it in
line.”
</p><!--l. 27119--><p class="indent" >  “Okay.”
</p><!--l. 27121--><p class="indent" >  “Now ask what happens if we have a centralized government. Now we pick one of
the nodes as representative of the others, and we draw one line from each of the nine
subordinates to the centrally governing node. Now there is only one line from each of
the subordinates. It is very cheap to maintain, but if a line gets broken, then they are
unbound by obligations. Then they are free of any order—they have fallen outside the
system. It is quite precarious.”
</p><!--l. 27129--><p class="indent" >  “But the central node still has nine lines.”
</p><!--l. 27131--><p class="indent" >  “True. The central node is still obliged to do as much work as before, but the
chance of keeping all its agreements is much smaller, because the likelihood of the
other agreements being broken is so much greater. That&#x2019;s where you try to break it
up.”
</p><!--l. 27136--><p class="indent" >  “If you can.”
</p><!--l. 27138--><p class="indent" >  “Isn&#x2019;t that what someone said today? At some point an operation becomes so big —
so complex that no one really sees what it is anymore. It becomes too big for anyone
to comprehend. It becomes a self-sustaining living organism. If you suddenly
change your mind and try to kill it, all of its parts will resist, try to protect
themselves.”
</p><!--l. 27146--><p class="indent" >  “You ought to nip these things in the bud,” she agrees. “But if you can cut the right
channels of communication.” She strikes through the central nodes in her
picture.
</p><!--l. 27151--><p class="indent" >  “You know, someone once told me that the reason the Nobel peace prize was in
Oslo rather than Stockholm was because Norway had never started a war. Now here
we are planning a war.”

</p><!--l. 27155--><p class="indent" >  Vibe thinks of her father. He would have laughed at the idea that Norway was so
squeaky clean. He once said that it was true enough that the raping and pillaging of
the Vikings did not count as declaring war since it was just individual misadventure,
not sanctioned by the state. So really, Norway was just being rewarded for its political
backwardness at the time. Her mother, who was not famous for her sense of humour,
had found this ﬂippant tomfoolery an aﬀront to Norway&#x2019;s dignity and had told them
so.
</p><!--l. 27164--><p class="indent" >  Text from Bea: “Drinks?”
</p><!--l. 27166--><p class="indent" >  She texts Bea: “Want to get to know new girl here. Meet up later?”
</p><!--l. 27168--><p class="indent" >  “All right, time out,” she declares.
</p><!--l. 27170--><p class="indent" >  “Thank god. . . so we can go home now?”

<!--l. 27178--><p class="indent" >  “My government would not support me, so I am supporting them,” Vibe tells
Preeta. They have found their way into the underground club, where Preeta found her
friend. She considers it a celebration of her freedom.
</p><!--l. 27182--><p class="indent" >  “It is something I learned from this game I have been playing. Sometimes you have
to take a loss to move forward. I came here because I realized I didn&#x2019;t have to wait for
approval of my advisor to ﬁgure this out. Call it arrogance or maybe inspiration. My
dad&#x2019;s always been a bad inﬂuence on my like that. And then the game reminded by of
my duty.”
</p><!--l. 27189--><p class="indent" >  “So what was your revelation?”
</p><!--l. 27191--><p class="indent" >  “Just something. It occurred to me that there is more going on here than what I am
doing. All this stuﬀ I&#x2019;ve been learning for the VeiVeks: it&#x2019;s all based on old studies in
social sciences, mathematical models that were done years ago. But those people
seem to have forgotten those old models they came up with, so now we have to teach
it back to them.”
</p><!--l. 27198--><p class="indent" >  “And you are willing to spend all this time and eﬀort working on something you are
not even sure you believe in?”
</p><!--l. 27201--><p class="indent" >  “Sometimes you&#x2019;ve gotta climb the mountain just to see if what you&#x2019;re looking for
is up there,” she notes, from personal experience. “You have to take a certain
risk.”
</p><!--l. 27205--><p class="indent" >  Preeta nods. “I think Dermot would not agree. He would say it was ineﬃcient.”
</p><!--l. 27208--><p class="indent" >  “So who is this Dermot, anyway?”
</p><!--l. 27210--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I keep wondering that myself. </span>“Mystery man.” She rolls her eyes a little. “He is a
very good game programmer that Mr. Bishop recruited from a local company. But he
is a little bit of a computer geek, I think. He is not so convinced of the importance of
this work. I think he has other things on his mind.”
</p><!--l. 27216--><p class="indent" >  “When do we get to meet him?”

</p><!--l. 27218--><p class="indent" >  “He ought to be here now. He&#x2019;s not showing it, but I think Bishop is furious that he
has not been in to work. We have no idea what he&#x2019;s doing. He is holding us back now.
None of us knows how to animate these agents like he does.”
</p><!--l. 27223--><p class="indent" >  “I could probably ﬁgure it out,” Vibe suggests carefully. “Maybe not as well as him,
but if he&#x2019;s not here. . .at a push.”
</p><!--l. 27226--><p class="indent" >  “Something tells me he will show up.”
</p><!--l. 27228--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">It&#x2019;s my fault, </span>she thinks. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I have to put things right.</span>
</p><!--l. 27230--><p class="indent" >  She casts her mind back to the evening when she left him at the bar and he ﬂed like
a scolded animal. It was not a nice thing to do to him. He seems so fragile,
not hardened to the world as she is. She sacriﬁced his conﬁdence for her
own, as though she ate his soul and became stronger. No, that is being too
melodramatic, but it doesn&#x2019;t change the fact that it is her fault. She will make it
right.
</p><!--l. 27237--><p class="indent" >  “So, what&#x2019;s it been like for you meeting the group?”
</p><!--l. 27239--><p class="indent" >  Vibe shrugs. “Okay. not that diﬀerent from the College really. What about you?
You haven&#x2019;t been here so long yourself from what I understand.”
</p><!--l. 27242--><p class="indent" >  “A few weeks. I am getting used to it. Even the darkness. Do you have a
boyfriend?”‘
</p><!--l. 27244--><p class="indent" >  She shakes her head. “Not as we speak.”
</p><!--l. 27246--><p class="indent" >  “Looking?”
</p><!--l. 27248--><p class="indent" >  Should she tell her about Peter Green? Maybe not tonight. Besides, what is that
really all about? She doesn&#x2019;t know what to think anymore.
</p><!--l. 27251--><p class="indent" >  “You?”
</p><!--l. 27253--><p class="indent" >  Preeta shakes her head.
</p><!--l. 27255--><p class="indent" >  “Someone you left behind?”
</p><!--l. 27257--><p class="indent" >  “No, no one.”
</p><!--l. 27259--><p class="indent" >  What is happening far away in Kuala Lumpur? Are they okay? Her friends could be
suﬀering because of her penchant for ﬂight.
</p><!--l. 27262--><p class="indent" >  “So we have to ﬁx you up with someone?”
</p><!--l. 27264--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m ﬁne for now, thank you.”
</p><!--l. 27266--><p class="indent" >  Are the Asian gangs still after her? Were they ever after her? Was it merely a ruse to
recruit her? Her head is still dizzy with the possibilities. Perhaps it is time to stand and
ﬁght her tormenters, whoever they are?
</p><!--l. 27271--><p class="indent" >  There is something to be learned from Vibe. She seems all too ready to confront
things; she doesn&#x2019;t run away. Can you really steer your destiny by running? When
these succubi learn to speak Punjabi, perhaps it will be possible to make a diﬀerence
to the Indo-Pakistani hinterlands.
</p><!--l. 27277--><p class="indent" >  Preeta watches the Interpol channels carefully every day, with the help of her
worms and assimilation agents. She means to know if they really want to ﬁnd her and
if her friends are all right. And if no information surfaces, then it could be because
there never was any gang. Nothing yet. In a sense, the very project they are working
on now gives her a way to draw a line in the sand. If she can borrow Vibe&#x2019;s courage,
she could make a diﬀerence.

</p><!--l. 27286--><p class="indent" >  “So you know about the police database,” Vibe slips in. “How would I go about
ﬁnding someone in the force?”
</p><!--l. 27289--><p class="indent" >  “Internationally?”
</p><!--l. 27291--><p class="indent" >  “No, here. When I was up in the mountains, I left something behind.”
</p><!--l. 27293--><p class="indent" >  Preeta wheedles the story of her backpack out of her, and Vibe tells it will a mixture
of girlish indignation and cheeky bravado.
</p><!--l. 27296--><p class="indent" >  “How are you going to get it back?”
</p><!--l. 27298--><p class="indent" >  “I thought I would try contacting Frank ﬁrst. He was nice.”
</p><!--l. 27300--><p class="indent" >  “You could go back?”
</p><!--l. 27302--><p class="indent" >  “Are you kidding? I don&#x2019;t want to make things worse.”
</p><!--l. 27304--><p class="indent" >  “Are you going to report the woman?”
</p><!--l. 27306--><p class="indent" >  “Why? What&#x2019;s the point?”
</p><!--l. 27308--><p class="indent" >  “Smuggling?”
</p><!--l. 27310--><p class="indent" >  “People have been smuggling ever since taxes were invented.”
</p><!--l. 27312--><p class="indent" >  People have diﬀerent ideas of right and wrong.
</p><!--l. 27314--><p class="indent" >  But who is she to judge? In the past few weeks, she has not only ﬂed from
responsibility into an unknown future, merely for her own selﬁsh gain, she has broken
every imaginable taboo from her upbringing. She would be chopped up and burned
alive if her family knew about her behaviour.
</p><!--l. 27319--><p class="indent" >  Vibe is a diﬀerent kind of creature altogether, she thinks. She is sleek and elegant,
but tough at the same time, like a Hollywood heroine, not like a Bollywood princess.
And now that she has conﬁded her story, Preeta can channel her admiration of her to
see that there is a template for her own life in there. If she could become more like this
Sara.
</p><!--l. 27326--><p class="indent" >  But has she really experienced the same kind of danger? Bravery is easy until
you have felt the ﬁngers of inevitable surrender touch your most vulnerable
parts.
</p><!--l. 27330--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t know if Bishop really thinks I can do the job without a lot of help. I don&#x2019;t
want to leave now and make a bad impression. Besides, I don&#x2019;t want to shatter his
squeaky image of me.”
</p><!--l. 27334--><p class="indent" >  “Squeaky? You think? Why is it that old people always underestimate young
people?”
</p><!--l. 27337--><p class="indent" >  “Wisdom comes with age?” Vibe jokes.
</p><!--l. 27339--><p class="indent" >  She laughs. “Prejudice comes with age. Knowledge, if you&#x2019;re lucky.”
</p><!--l. 27341--><p class="indent" >  “I want to show him I can.”
</p><!--l. 27343--><p class="indent" >  “Good for you.”
</p><!--l. 27345--><p class="indent" >  “We can do it together.”
</p><!--l. 27347--><p class="indent" >  Preeta. “Yes. I think we can.”
</p><!--l. 27349--><p class="indent" >  Vibe regards her with a sly look. “So, tell me your story,” Vibe probes. “One of the
boys was telling me it sounds exciting.”
</p><!--l. 27353--><p class="indent" >  Preeta goes blank. “That&#x2019;s a long story. Maybe it should wait for another
time.”
</p><!--l. 27356--><p class="indent" >  Vibe shrugs. “Okay.”

</p><!--l. 27358--><p class="indent" >  “I have a better idea.”
</p><!--l. 27360--><p class="indent" >  “What?”
</p><!--l. 27362--><p class="indent" >  “What about maybe you can help me ﬁnd some new clothes? I have been trying to
do some shopping since I came here.”
</p><!--l. 27365--><p class="indent" >  The ﬁres of a diﬀerent daemon summon a mischievous sparkle in Vibe&#x2019;s eyes. “Oh.
. .now we&#x2019;re talking.”
</p><!--l. 27368--><p class="indent" >  She consults her mobile and starts to text a brief message into her wrist
band.
</p><!--l. 27371--><p class="indent" >  “So you&#x2019;ll take me shopping?”
</p><!--l. 27373--><p class="indent" >  “Hmmm. I think we need to introduce you to my friend Bea. You&#x2019;re right. It&#x2019;s about
time we did a little prospecting.”

</p><!--l. 27391--><p class="indent" >  “I see it as my duty to be a kind of agent provocateur, Señor Morris. You are a yea
sayer.”
</p><!--l. 27394--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;ve made a career of it,” he replies with sarcasm.
</p><!--l. 27396--><p class="indent" >  Den suppresses a rising frustration. His meeting is not working out as he had hoped.
Catalin Constanca Alexandra Cortina has conceded interest in the fact that he did not
simply run home with his tail between his legs, after their last meeting. She has made
herself available for a rematch. It has not changed much, however. He might have won
a little attention from her critical eye, but he has a long way to go before he can claim
to have her respect.
</p><!--l. 27405--><p class="indent" >  She has agreed to meet him, for a second time, this time away from her impressive
and distracting home. The little courtyard café nestles amongst the historical buildings
of the old town. He expected that this neutral territory would remove her obvious
advantage, but he is beginning to wonder.
</p><!--l. 27411--><p class="indent" >  She looks at him with an almost patronizing derision. Their sparring is not entirely
friendly, he knows.
</p><!--l. 27414--><p class="indent" >  “Really? In my experience, Señor Morris, when people say they are looking for a
career, what they mean is that they have no idea what to do. They are, in fact, looking
for guidance. They want a place to belong and be held by the hand. They are not ready
to move society forward by themselves, they are merely hoping to hitch a ride into
retirement.”
</p><!--l. 27421--><p class="indent" >  “And you think I am such a person.”
</p><!--l. 27423--><p class="indent" >  “Are you telling me that you want to make a diﬀerence now, or are you simply
changing allegiances?”
</p><!--l. 27426--><p class="indent" >  He summons all of his self-control, stuﬃng his ego a box that he can open to
release the scream later. “You go out of your way to insult me,” he says calmly. “Is
this how you usually do your business?”
</p><!--l. 27431--><p class="indent" >  “Here in the Basque we like to be direct. I do not have time for time-wasters. I have
taken on an enormous task and it consumes me.”

</p><!--l. 27434--><p class="indent" >  “But you run a business along side your other activities. You know that we have to
make a living from our work.”
</p><!--l. 27437--><p class="indent" >  “At the expense of principles?”
</p><!--l. 27439--><p class="indent" >  “Aren&#x2019;t there some principles that have to be compromised to live in the real
world?”
</p><!--l. 27442--><p class="indent" >  “That depends on the skill of the individual.”
</p><!--l. 27444--><p class="indent" >  “Or on the constraints of your company.”
</p><!--l. 27446--><p class="indent" >  “Ah, a company man,” she chides. “My company looks after me. I love my
company.”
</p><!--l. 27449--><p class="indent" >  “But you are also a company woman, surely,” he presses, barely concealing his
exasperation with her. Is she trying to make him show weakness?
</p><!--l. 27453--><p class="indent" >  “Companies can be both awesome and terrible at the same time,” she dodges.
“Godlike and mind numbing. They lure you in like the wolf in the Little Red Riding
Hood, yes? They give you your hood and tell you where to look, what to see, when to
open and close your eyes. Then they give you a kind of life plan, to replace whatever
you might have had. They promise to save your soul by delivering you from idleness,
while they make you sign it away to the ﬁres of hell, forcing you against others in
competition.”
</p><!--l. 27462--><p class="indent" >  “You&#x2019;re talking about workers, not management.”
</p><!--l. 27464--><p class="indent" >  “Are you sure?”
</p><!--l. 27466--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t see myself in that position.”
</p><!--l. 27468--><p class="indent" >  “You probably help to design indoctrination packages for companies.”
</p><!--l. 27470--><p class="indent" >  “That is one of the things we do, yes.”
</p><!--l. 27472--><p class="indent" >  “And this is not for management too?”
</p><!--l. 27474--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">She&#x2019;s right</span>, he thinks. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Damn it.</span>
</p><!--l. 27476--><p class="indent" >  He attempts to maneuver out of her trap. “So you don&#x2019;t think it is possible for
someone like me to want to do the right thing? Isn&#x2019;t that a bit hypocritical? What
makes you so much better?”
</p><!--l. 27480--><p class="indent" >  “Actions speak louder than words, Mr. Morris. I am still waiting to see what you
will do. I would like nothing more than to have you as an ally, but which gods do you
worship?”
</p><!--l. 27484--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t think I worship. . .”
</p><!--l. 27486--><p class="indent" >  “I think you worship perfection, for a start. You need approval for what you
do.”
</p><!--l. 27488--><p class="indent" >  He nods. “You might be right. But I am willing to listen to criticism. Can you say
the same?”
</p><!--l. 27491--><p class="indent" >  “Bravo. Listening is one thing. But will you take the necessary decisions? Will you
implement the necessary measures to make things happen?”
</p><!--l. 27494--><p class="indent" >  She lifts her hands and looks up, as if reaching out, but always her burning gaze
refocuses on his.
</p><!--l. 27497--><p class="indent" >  “Education has become my main priority. It is where everything begins. It will be
either our future or our epitaph.”
</p><!--l. 27500--><p class="indent" >  “I can see that. But what can someone like me do about that?”

</p><!--l. 27502--><p class="indent" >  “But that is what someone like you must tell someone like me. That is your job,
your speciality. Marketing is a subtle thing, I think. How can you bring this message
to the world?”
</p><!--l. 27506--><p class="indent" >  “I suppose there are ways.”
</p><!--l. 27508--><p class="indent" >  “What about that book that recently became a bestseller, something that everyone is
talking about. A conspiracy that makes everyone curious. Just that one book might
stimulate thousands of new readers to become literate. A simple trash novel might
have a huge positive eﬀect on the world. Is that not a signiﬁcant result? So much
better than making people play passive games. How could you do the same in Africa
or America?”
</p><!--l. 27516--><p class="indent" >  “Well, games are not just games anymore. They are whole environments. We might
have actually come back full circle—to the point where people are making their own
entertainment with what they ﬁnd in the games. There is actual thinking involved in
gaming now.”
</p><!--l. 27521--><p class="indent" >  “In research, our budgets are controlled by the opportunities programmes. That
deﬁnes the areas on which one is allowed to concentrate. Huge amounts of money are
thrown away on trend setting. But as a marketing manager you could deﬁne new
trends. You can make things cool or necessary.”
</p><!--l. 27527--><p class="indent" >  “That is what the game consortium wants,” he agrees. “There doesn&#x2019;t have to be a
contradiction between encouraging learning and sending the messages that they want
to send.”
</p><!--l. 27531--><p class="indent" >  “And what are these messages? Believe in the authority of the President? Believe in
the authority of God and the Church. These are all very well, but they are not the
messages that will save society in the log run. They are a plaster on a sore—one that
will hurt when you have to rip it oﬀ again.”
</p><!--l. 27537--><p class="indent" >  “I am not a Christian, by any stretch of the imagination, but I can see the value of
rebuilding community. The argument is that mobiles have eﬀectively isolated people,
by. . .”
</p><!--l. 27541--><p class="indent" >  “I know the arguments, Señor. They might be true in parts of Europe or
Russia and Japan, but in the U.S.? People have a culture of talking there. They
blabber even more than the people of Spain! All right, they might not say
anything signiﬁcant to anyone oﬀ mobile, but they can still look one another in
the eye. No, the problem is the fragmentation. The need for guidance and
welfare. Keep me safe, at any cost, even if the cost is my individuality, my
soul.”
</p><!--l. 27549--><p class="indent" >  “A deal with the devil?”
</p><!--l. 27551--><p class="indent" >  “When people expect the state or the environment to look after them, then
they have lost the human spirit, the will to survive. They would rather sue
someone if it rains and they get wet, than ﬁnd a way to adapt and learn from the
mistake. What they need is not a prayer group, but the presence of mind to make
critical observations about the world. By telling them to accept the authority
of a government or a church, all they have done is to stick people together
with some glue. It is artiﬁcial. If people are transmitters of ideas, not just

receivers, if they mix and talk and criticize one another—that is how a society
works.”
</p><!--l. 27562--><p class="indent" >  “But the game consortium is trying to do exactly that.”
</p><!--l. 27564--><p class="indent" >  “Do you believe that? I think they have you wrapped around their, what you say,
little ﬁnger?”
</p><!--l. 27567--><p class="indent" >  He ignores her thrust. “You have some interesting perspectives,” he says simply.
“You&#x2019;ve told me about a side of things that I had not thought about and I want to go
back to High Wycombe and think through what you have told me. It would be helpful
if you were more supportive of the eﬀort. I didn&#x2019;t have to come here, and I don&#x2019;t have
to help you now.”
</p><!--l. 27574--><p class="indent" >  “But I don&#x2019;t want you to help me. I want you to do it for its own sake.”
</p><!--l. 27576--><p class="indent" >  “It could be no other way.”
</p><!--l. 27578--><p class="indent" >  “Why did you come here?”
</p><!--l. 27580--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Tell the truth, she will not believe anything else</span>.
</p><!--l. 27582--><p class="indent" >  “Why? Because, as part of my research I am trying to identify the most important
individuals in the game consortium. Your name came up, for obvious reasons. I
wanted to know if I could use you as a vector in a campaign.”

that the game project could be used to do considerable good in the world. I still think
so, but that is not everyone&#x2019;s motivation.”

</p><!--l. 27608--><p class="indent" >  “But only as a true believer.”

</p><!--l. 27625--><p class="indent" >  “Now you are a big man—a ﬁgurehead.”
</p><!--l. 27627--><p class="indent" >  He ponders. “It seems like a small thing, a change of style. To make people use
their minds. To ask questions. To think about what they see.”
</p><!--l. 27631--><p class="indent" >  “These opportunities are born of our little weaknesses.”

</p><!--l. 27633--><p class="indent" >  “Then here&#x2019;s to those moments of weakness,” he salutes with his glass and drinks
the rest of the water. “If what you say is true, they won&#x2019;t last long anyway, once
people start to cotton on.”
</p><!--l. 27637--><p class="indent" >  She nods. “If more people start to think for themselves you will have to rethink
your strategy. But I think that is something you have to do anyway in your
business.”
</p><!--l. 27642--><p class="indent" >  He nods. “I think I can sell the idea to my company. The game consortium just have
to like the results we produce. They don&#x2019;t even have to be aware that there is an
ulterior motive. As long as we can still make money.”
</p><!--l. 27647--><p class="indent" >  “You will have to be careful. They are not stupid, at least not in that way.”
</p><!--l. 27649--><p class="indent" >  “They seem to think I am the expert on this. I can bring them around, pull their
strings.”
</p><!--l. 27652--><p class="indent" >  “Perhaps they are really pulling your strings, as you put it?”
</p><!--l. 27654--><p class="indent" >  “You keep implying that. Why do you think I am so inept?”
</p><!--l. 27656--><p class="indent" >  “Because you are a yea sayer, because you seek approval.”
</p><!--l. 27658--><p class="indent" >  “No, give me some credit. I think that I have been getting what I want out of this,
and I&#x2019;ve done quite well so far.”
</p><!--l. 27661--><p class="indent" >  “Or they make you think so.”
</p><!--l. 27663--><p class="indent" >  He sighs, beyond anger now. “You don&#x2019;t have a very high opinion of me.”

cruelly.

So far, they have been trying to force feed ideas, but this is just provoking game
players to rebel. It is too authoritarian. Too obviously manipulative. It is like
listening to your parents tell you what to do. But suppose you could make
education seem subversive to the establishment, then teenagers would go for it,
as well as more radical adults. The hip-hop gangs would rebel against this
straight away, although they usually respond only to instructions that come by

homosexuals actually become cool and exotic. Then you begin to admire the

been back for several days after her ﬂing on the town, and he has not been
motivated to ﬁgure things out without her. Since then he has been hiding
himself. Now he has heard from Bishop that she is spending time with this new
girl.
</p><!--l. 28155--><p class="indent" >  Another girl.

</p><!--l. 28192--><p class="indent" >  “What about when they wanted to invade all those middle eastern countries?”

</p><!--l. 28195--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah, then they had to spread this doctrine of war and interventionism, whereas

Coz, you can&#x2019;t have a message of peace and optimism getting so popular across the

sex with them.
</p><!--l. 28218--><p class="indent" >  As for this business of Bishop&#x2019;s, he is glad to get away from it for a while. He is
employed to work on gaming related projects, on an hourly basis, but it doesn&#x2019;t say
anything in his contract about hunting down and persecuting anyone for their religious
beliefs. What are they? The Ku Klux Klan backwards? Why is he so hung up
on religion, anyway? Dermot can agree that abuse of power is a bad thing,
but isn&#x2019;t the church a good thing? If it brings comfort to people who cannot
succeed without help, isn&#x2019;t that as good as any other kind of institution of
society?
</p><!--l. 28227--><p class="indent" >  Bishop has been looking tired and grey lately: lined and dusty, as if he has been
cradled and absorbed by some giant moth. It has not seemed like a good time to
disturb him. That and the fact that he is avoiding Preeta.
</p><!--l. 28231--><p class="indent" >  Bishop says that they are trying to make society stable, but Dermot is not sure that
he really understands the logic. Stability means that something is sluggish, hard to
change, hard to control. Isn&#x2019;t it change he wants? Too much stability is called
stagnation.
</p><!--l. 28236--><p class="indent" >  And what would it take to de-stabilize it? Rumour or propaganda, call it what you
like. These are the weapons of information. Viruses that spread like wildﬁre. It doesn&#x2019;t
take long to discredit someone. But what are the repercussions?
</p><!--l. 28242--><p class="indent" >  Dermot is trying to concern himself with other things: things that do not hurt his
head.
</p><!--l. 28245--><p class="indent" >  Even just burying himself in the details of work on the project would be okay, if he
didn&#x2019;t feel so pathetic. But he does. Where did all these imported geniuses come
from? What use is he? Now there is a third person involved. Sara. Another girl. He
wishes he could face them with cheer and self-conﬁdence, but all he feels is that he is
a freak.
</p><!--l. 28252--><p class="indent" >  Preeta has started to send him messages. Where are you? What are you doing? Now
he has received another message from her. He ought to reply, but it is diﬃcult. He&#x2019;ll
do it soon.

</p><!--l. 28256--><p class="indent" >  The last one says that they are going out to buy clothes: she and the new girl. Does
he want to join them and have a make-over? Sounds like a nightmare. What does he
know about that anyway? Clothes ought to be just simple to choose and cheap so
you can throw them away and get new ones often. And someone should just
decide for you what to wear, so you don&#x2019;t have to spend time and worry
thinking about it. It should be the government&#x2019;s responsibility to decorate the
people.
</p><!--l. 28264--><p class="indent" >  He texts “I can&#x2019;t make it, I have a date.” Then he deletes the text and cancels the
reply.
</p><!--l. 28267--><p class="indent" >  He wishes he did have a date. That would be an exaggeration, but he has been
working his way to persuade Christina to let him come back and see her. He needs to
see her. He wants to touch her. He can almost imagine the grimace of her suspicion.
The trouble is that all he can think about is her. He wants to save her, to hold her, to . .
. you know.
</p><!--l. 28273--><p class="indent" >  He read once that no one ever loved anyone for being perfect. You generally end up
loving people for their faults. If that is true, then he must be madly consumed by love
for Christina.

</p><!--l. 28289--><p class="indent" >  Christmas trees are going up in shop windows and this symbol of good cheers has

</p><!--l. 28298--><p class="indent" >  He has been in and looked at the work the others are doing. This new girl is
pretty good, for an amateur. The campaign they are supposed to be ﬁghting

subliminal advertising. About the only thing they still have control over is the
weather.
</p><!--l. 28305--><p class="indent" >  They are trying to make a succubus by taking an existing agent and modifying it.
They are guessing at these things and doing quite well, but they need his help. How
could anyone but him see what he sees inside this code? Look at the beauty of the
stanzas of precision language! Maybe he is not so useless after all. He feels a bit like

a school child who has been asked to comment on the meaning of Keats
except that, where such humanities left him only confused and unmoved,
these stanzas burst with meaning, both intriguing and logical. He knows this
stuﬀ.

light seems to press down upon the streets, as if squeezing from it an electricity that
lifts the hairs on his neck.
</p><!--l. 28326--><p class="indent" >  Preeta has ﬁnally persuaded him to meet. Alone. He does not want to see the new
girl, or the others. Not yet, at least. She places her coﬀee cup down on the window sill
table, and climbs up onto the stool beside him. They sit there looking out onto the
town from the window.
</p><!--l. 28332--><p class="indent" >  “They put the tinsel on the trees all wrong here,” Preeta says, looking at the tree
across the road and trying to strike up a conversation.
</p><!--l. 28336--><p class="indent" >  The silver tinsel is hung in radial stripes: spokes emanating from the point of the
tree to the base, like go-faster stripes.
</p><!--l. 28339--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s the way we do it here,” he defends.
</p><!--l. 28341--><p class="indent" >  “But the tinsel is supposed to look like snow resting on the branches. You&#x2019;re
supposed to coil it around the tree.”
</p><!--l. 28344--><p class="indent" >  He looks at her blankly.
</p><!--l. 28346--><p class="indent" >  She nudges him. “It is supposed to look like a tree, not a nuclear warhead!”
</p><!--l. 28350--><p class="indent" >  It is cold out in the wintery wonderland. They can sit and do their work in the
coﬀee shop overlooking the shoe store on Grensen: on the edge of Oslo reality. It is
hard to work here, with the bustling interruption of the customers, but it is pleasant
until someone opens the door and douses them with icicles of frozen air that stab at
their bare skin.
</p><!--l. 28357--><p class="indent" >  The coming of Christmas has always been hard for Dermot. It is the time when
society crystallizes into a single shape, a shape into which he cannot ﬁt. The
lattice has no space for him in its perfection. It is the ultimate inducement to
conformity.
</p><!--l. 28362--><p class="indent" >  “I can never quite get used to the roads here,” she says. “They seem too perfect, too
cold.”
</p><!--l. 28365--><p class="indent" >  “They work, more or less.”
</p><!--l. 28367--><p class="indent" >  “Look,” she says. “I am sorry about me. I behaved very badly. We might have
ﬁnished our succubus if I hadn&#x2019;t pushed you away. I am very ashamed.”
</p><!--l. 28371--><p class="indent" >  He shakes his head. “Don&#x2019;t worry about it.”
</p><!--l. 28373--><p class="indent" >  She shakes her head.

</p><!--l. 28385--><p class="indent" >  “Vibe?”
</p><!--l. 28387--><p class="indent" >  “Well, her name is really Sara. I&#x2019;m not quite sure why she calls herself
Vibe.”

quite fearless.”
</p><!--l. 28399--><p class="indent" >  Dermot laughs in his own way. “What about you? ”
</p><!--l. 28401--><p class="indent" >  “Me?”

that?”
</p><!--l. 28410--><p class="indent" >  She shrugs. “I have been doing that all my life. I have always been lucky by it. Not
bravery, something else.”
</p><!--l. 28413--><p class="indent" >  Dermot looks at her with pained but genuine admiration. How he wishes that he
could be the same.
</p><!--l. 28416--><p class="indent" >  Preeta says. “Well look. Someone got me ﬁred. But at the same time, someone sent
me here.”
</p><!--l. 28419--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re here,” he says, surprising himself most of all.
</p><!--l. 28421--><p class="indent" >  Preeta grins broadly and, seeing his crimson cheeks glow, decides not to let him
dwell on his embarrassment. “I&#x2019;ve been out with the new girl and her friend quite a
lot. I like them.”
</p><!--l. 28425--><p class="indent" >  “Really. What do you do?”
</p><!--l. 28427--><p class="indent" >  “Mostly drink beer and meet friends. Stay out late.”
</p><!--l. 28429--><p class="indent" >  “Last night? I tried to contact you.”
</p><!--l. 28431--><p class="indent" >  “Mostly, we drank a lot of beer until very late. Then Sara&#x2019;s friend came with even
more beer. She said it was for breakfast.” She giggles.
</p><!--l. 28435--><p class="indent" >  They settle down into a quiet pondering, watching the snowﬂakes fall. Preeta sings,
“I&#x2019;m dreaming of a white. . ..”
</p><!--l. 28438--><p class="indent" >  “Girlfriend,” Dermot ﬁnishes,
</p><!--l. 28440--><p class="indent" >  They laugh.
</p><!--l. 28442--><p class="indent" >  They are not so diﬀerent, she thinks. What is the diﬀerence between ﬂeeing a
physical persecution and ﬂeeing a mental persecution from yourself? She actually
feels sympathy for him. She is not accustomed to having feelings for anyone at
all.

</p><!--l. 28447--><p class="indent" >  “You know,” she says, “I am going to be here for the winter at least. You
could invite me for Christmas.” She adds: “If you wanted to, of course. .

</p><!--l. 28451--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t you want to spend Christmas with your girl?”
</p><!--l. 28453--><p class="indent" >  She shrugs. “I don&#x2019;t even know her. And besides, perhaps I would like to escape
from myself for a week.”
</p><!--l. 28456--><p class="indent" >  He smiles. “All right, I&#x2019;d like that.”
</p><!--l. 28458--><p class="indent" >  “You are not Christian are you? I mean songs and stuﬀ?”
</p><!--l. 28460--><p class="indent" >  He laughs. “No, nothing like that.”
</p><!--l. 28464--><p class="indent" >  “Didn&#x2019;t you celebrate Christmas in Malaysia?”
</p><!--l. 28466--><p class="indent" >  “I was brought up a Muslim.”
</p><!--l. 28468--><p class="indent" >  “Not even secular Christmas?”
</p><!--l. 28470--><p class="indent" >  “What&#x2019;s that?”
</p><!--l. 28472--><p class="indent" >  “What most people celebrate.”
</p><!--l. 28474--><p class="indent" >  “I didn&#x2019;t know about it. Or I don&#x2019;t think I did.”
</p><!--l. 28476--><p class="indent" >  “Not even from TV?”
</p><!--l. 28478--><p class="indent" >  She shrugs.
</p><!--l. 28480--><p class="indent" >  “You wouldn&#x2019;t have been allowed?”
</p><!--l. 28482--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t know.”
</p><!--l. 28484--><p class="indent" >  “Really.”
</p><!--l. 28486--><p class="indent" >  She looks glumly into her coﬀee. “The hardest thing to accept sometimes is that
you can actually think for yourself. We are taught to believe what people tell us. We
are encouraged not to ask too many questions.”
</p><!--l. 28491--><p class="indent" >  “For the sake of eﬃciency it is best not to question everything all of the
time”
</p><!--l. 28494--><p class="indent" >  “Even when I was paid to think, I was not expected to think for myself. My boss
thought of me just a stupid slave.”
</p><!--l. 28497--><p class="indent" >  “So you left?”
</p><!--l. 28499--><p class="indent" >  “So I . . . branched out.”
</p><!--l. 28501--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s what you get for underestimating people.”
</p><!--l. 28503--><p class="indent" >  “Well, the reality is that I was sacked for my thinking.”
</p><!--l. 28505--><p class="indent" >  “Sacked?”
</p><!--l. 28507--><p class="indent" >  “He couldn&#x2019;t lose face. My boss. You know, in India we have castes. We don&#x2019;t talk
about it much, but everyone understands it.”
</p><!--l. 28510--><p class="indent" >  “Perhaps you should.”
</p><!--l. 28512--><p class="indent" >  “The ruling class believes that the lower castes are . . . beneath them. There is
not just upper class and lower class in India – there is a whole spectrum of
prejudice.”
</p><!--l. 28516--><p class="indent" >  He shrugs barely with his lips. “I&#x2019;m sorry.”
</p><!--l. 28518--><p class="indent" >  “I will not say that society could do without classes but I will say that lower class
does not mean worthless or stupid. I was the one who solve the problems,” she says,
suppressing anger.
</p><!--l. 28522--><p class="indent" >  He nods.

</p><!--l. 28524--><p class="indent" >  “Perhaps it is not something you have experienced directly.”
</p><!--l. 28526--><p class="indent" >  He shakes his head, uncertainly. Generally he is good enough at punishing
himself.
</p><!--l. 28529--><p class="indent" >  “It is reason enough to run away.”
</p><!--l. 28531--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t you feel much like a slave here too? I mean, is it so much better
here?”
</p><!--l. 28534--><p class="indent" >  “Here it is diﬀerent,” she thinks aloud. “I am treated like an equal, even though I am
expected to do a job.” She smiles. “Besides, you don&#x2019;t work very hard here. For me, it
is like a holiday.”
</p><!--l. 28538--><p class="indent" >  Dermot grins and hides it in his mocha latte. She might be right about some of the

</p><!--l. 28545--><p class="indent" >  “Does that mean you are going to come and help us ﬁnish our succubus?”
</p><!--l. 28547--><p class="indent" >  “I suppose I should.”
</p><!--l. 28549--><p class="indent" >  “You don&#x2019;t want to miss it. It is actually a lot of fun since the new girl came. She
makes a nice atmosphere.”

</p><!--l. 28554--><p class="indent" >  “When you ﬁrst came here, you said there was a problem with the game that might
work to our advantage. At least, that&#x2019;s how I heard you.”
</p><!--l. 28557--><p class="indent" >  “Yes. I said that. There are problems.”
</p><!--l. 28559--><p class="indent" >  “What kind of problems?”
</p><!--l. 28561--><p class="indent" >  “Well the visible symptoms are things like broken billboards and sims going
wrong. There are bugs in the system. I realized that much before I came
here.”
</p><!--l. 28565--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, I&#x2019;ve seen that.”
</p><!--l. 28567--><p class="indent" >  “But that&#x2019;s not the problem. It&#x2019;s just what we see.”
</p><!--l. 28569--><p class="indent" >  “So what is the problem?”
</p><!--l. 28571--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I don&#x2019;t know. My guess is that there are too many human interests in the
simulations. Money, power, propaganda – you know, it&#x2019;s all going on. Big companies
are playing the game like a new marketplace. Smart buﬀering can ﬁlter out advertising
from video, but not from the game, so the game represents a new channel for selling
things. That much is obvious.”
</p><!--l. 28578--><p class="indent" >  “So is there a problem with the advertising?”
</p><!--l. 28580--><p class="indent" >  “Well, yes and no. I think it is the outsourcing of the game coding that has led to the
problems we are seeing with rendering.”
</p><!--l. 28583--><p class="indent" >  “What do you mean?”
</p><!--l. 28585--><p class="indent" >  “The game is too ambitious for any one company or organization. They have split
up the development into partnerships, with a set of rules and regulations in the
contracts.”
</p><!--l. 28590--><p class="indent" >  Getting a message through to someone when you want to is not as straightforward
as it could be, he knows, from personal experience. But it helps at least to have a rule
book, so you know what game you&#x2019;re playing. He wishes he had one for his personal

life.
</p><!--l. 28595--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah – we&#x2019;re one of them.”
</p><!--l. 28597--><p class="indent" >  “Ruling class, working class.”
</p><!--l. 28599--><p class="indent" >  “Well, and a bit of anarchy. . .”
</p><!--l. 28601--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s too big.”
</p><!--l. 28603--><p class="indent" >  “For users?”
</p><!--l. 28605--><p class="indent" >  “For the planet.”
</p><!--l. 28607--><p class="indent" >  Dermot laughs but cuts its short when he sees her reaction. “Sorry. I don&#x2019;t
understand what you mean.”
</p><!--l. 28610--><p class="indent" >  “They have tried to cope with the demand by outsourcing to slave companies.”
</p><!--l. 28613--><p class="indent" >  “Yes. Like us.”
</p><!--l. 28615--><p class="indent" >  “The errors are occurring because of the sourcing companies are just following the
rule book. But there is an error or an omission in the book. They haven&#x2019;t considered
the eﬀect of conﬂicts between the billboards and the avatar simulations. There are
segmentation problems that I have seen in the code during testing.”
</p><!--l. 28621--><p class="indent" >  Dermot shrugs. “Bane of the programmer. Segmentation.”
</p><!--l. 28623--><p class="indent" >  “But by having so many people working on the same thing, without any reasonable
protections, there are collisions and contentions.”
</p><!--l. 28626--><p class="indent" >  He nods. “I&#x2019;ve noticed some of that, it&#x2019;s a pretty simplistic interface.”
</p><!--l. 28628--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s why people trust it, but trust doesn&#x2019;t imply reliability. Well, that&#x2019;s only one
problem. The game has built in load balancing, right?”
</p><!--l. 28631--><p class="indent" >  He nods.
</p><!--l. 28633--><p class="indent" >  “It moves the diﬀerent characters from machine to machine. That&#x2019;s how they can
run it all on cheap PC hardware and spread it around the world and capture third
world markets.”
</p><!--l. 28637--><p class="indent" >  “Of course,” he says impatiently. Does she think he&#x2019;s stupid now?
</p><!--l. 28639--><p class="indent" >  “But even with the load balancing the expected throughput is now too
high.”
</p><!--l. 28641--><p class="indent" >  He waits for the conclusion.
</p><!--l. 28643--><p class="indent" >  “Not for the system, but for the users. There is a limit to how much information
humans can absorb. They are already at the maximum theoretical limit for human
perception. If you anything bigger, it just starts to get worse.”
</p><!--l. 28648--><p class="indent" >  “How do you know what the limit is?”
</p><!--l. 28650--><p class="indent" >  “I was reading a research paper from somewhere in Japan. They have a lot of
experience of this.”
</p><!--l. 28653--><p class="indent" >  He is giving her a look.
</p><!--l. 28655--><p class="indent" >  “I read sometimes, okay? I want to go back to college when I can aﬀord
to.”
</p><!--l. 28658--><p class="indent" >  “Okay,” he says. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">What did I say?</span>
</p><!--l. 28660--><p class="indent" >  “I was reading some of the references that are in the deep documentation for the
game manuals. It seemed like a natural thing to do to ﬁgure out this problem, so that
our company could make a good impression.”
</p><!--l. 28665--><p class="indent" >  “You think there are too many messages in the game.”

</p><!--l. 28667--><p class="indent" >  “The density is most likely too high. Even programmers and testers are being
aﬀected. I saw things in Malaysia that you probably do not have access to. When they
send the job to us, they don&#x2019;t expect us to understand anything, but what they don&#x2019;t
realize that we do our jobs well.”
</p><!--l. 28672--><p class="indent" >  “So?”
</p><!--l. 28674--><p class="indent" >  “Something has not been going right. There are rooms in the VR where odd stuﬀ
has been going on. Some of the controlling avatars have been altered and the program
seems to be stabilizing around a conﬁguration that is not what we were asked to
deliver.”
</p><!--l. 28679--><p class="indent" >  “I think that the process surrounding the program and all of its integrated pieces has
somehow reached the point where it is working against itself. The game rules are
about persuasion and I think that, in testing this game, the persuasion has
fed back—persuaded some of the programmers in your team to alter the
avatars.”
</p><!--l. 28685--><p class="indent" >  Dermot&#x2019;s eyes widen. What a seriously cool idea. A program that re-programs its
programmer. Could it be possible? There is something in what she is saying. That is
reason of itself to go back and help them work on this.
</p><!--l. 28690--><p class="indent" >  “I am not saying that this is a simple or direct action. It is subtle. It has layers of
complexity. It cannot be just a simple thing. It is more like a popular movement that
has been started.”
</p><!--l. 28694--><p class="indent" >  “Did you report it to the bug centre?”
</p><!--l. 28696--><p class="indent" >  “The requests got rejected every time I tried to initiate contact.”
</p><!--l. 28698--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I know that feeling</span>, Dermot thinks, thinking of his attempts to contact
Christina..
</p><!--l. 28701--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s a trust problem. Actually it is easier to wait until the other party comes to you.
That way it is easier for them to trust the connection.”
</p><!--l. 28705--><p class="indent" >  Dermot considers the idea, still thinking of Christina. There is something to
it.
</p><!--l. 28707--><p class="indent" >  “We still need to work on this campaign. We can&#x2019;t do anything about the
billboards, but we have normal game channels. The new girl said we have to make
people reevaluate their priorities, distract them. If there is one dominant signal,
make another one to compete with it. Make the second one look like the ﬁrst,
so that people can&#x2019;t tell the diﬀerence. That makes the odds ﬁfty-ﬁfty for
success.”
</p><!--l. 28716--><p class="indent" >  “Ehm. Look, I need to go and make a call. See someone.”
</p><!--l. 28718--><p class="indent" >  She nods. Obviously there&#x2019;s something going on with Dermot. She should let him
sort it out and she has a feeling that she cannot help.
</p><!--l. 28721--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">No need to tell the others yet.</span>
</p><!--l. 28723--><p class="indent" >  She recognizes the need to protect the weak.

<!--l. 28729--><p class="indent" >  When Dermot arrives at her ﬂat, Christina is sitting at her combo looking at its
screen rather than using the glasses.
</p><!--l. 28732--><p class="indent" >  She smiles broadly as he enters, but does not get up. “Did you get it?”
</p><!--l. 28734--><p class="indent" >  He holds his bag up as if to show her the replacement module.
</p><!--l. 28736--><p class="indent" >  “Sorry, it&#x2019;s a mess,” she says, as though it were somehow an unusual state of
aﬀairs.
</p><!--l. 28739--><p class="indent" >  Dermot shrugs. He doesn&#x2019;t care. His eyes scan her long, skinny legs under a grey
trouser fabric. She has her legs crossed in front of the screen. It accentuates her slight
curves and makes her tiny breasts look larger.
</p><!--l. 28744--><p class="indent" >  “I was just looking at some pictures. Take a look,” she says. She pops into a history
folder and starts bringing up pictures of naked girls. The pictures are not slutty, but
tasteful pictures obviously taken by a professional, with nice lighting and quality
poses.
</p><!--l. 28749--><p class="indent" >  “I think she is really pretty,” Christina says. “Nice breasts. Not too big, not too
small.”
</p><!--l. 28752--><p class="indent" >  Dermot is a little surprised by this, but he has come to be less shocked than curious
about her behaviour. He crouches down beside her, glad to be missing a chair because
it means that he is closer to her body. He supports himself by putting his hand on the
chair, so that it is just touching her thigh. He can smell her soapy clean body under the
clothes and feels himself respond.
</p><!--l. 28759--><p class="indent" >  “Some of them are pretty wild. There&#x2019;s a picture here that has two of the girls
licking each other.”
</p><!--l. 28762--><p class="indent" >  He looks at the picture and it is nice, but he is more concerned with the proximity
of her arm. He desperately wants to put his hand on her leg and run it up her body and
then kiss her and. . ..she knows that he is aroused. He knows that she knows, but when
he looks for the faintest sign of an invitation he ﬁnds nothing in her frozen
features.
</p><!--l. 28769--><p class="indent" >  “Just look that,” she adds.
</p><!--l. 28771--><p class="indent" >  He sighs quietly. “They are pretty hot,” he says, not quite sure what he should
say.
</p><!--l. 28774--><p class="indent" >  “I didn&#x2019;t show it to you to get you horny,” she says irritably and gets up to walk into
the kitchen. He hears her switch on the kettle.
</p><!--l. 28777--><p class="indent" >  Has he failed her test now? Or passed it? What does she want anyway? He
perches himself on the chair that we she was sitting in a moment ago and
opens his bag, pulling out the module. It is a trivial operation to take out
the old one and put the new one in, but he wants to make the most of her
gratitude. He waits until she is looking at him, probably thinking what a
loser he is for not making a move, then twists the combo around to get at the
module.
</p><!--l. 28785--><p class="indent" >  As he is working, she ﬂips through channels on the TV. He searches desperately for
some topic of conversation, but there is nothing there. Finally, she says, “How much

do I owe you?”
</p><!--l. 28789--><p class="indent" >  He receives the blow quietly. “Oh, don&#x2019;t worry about it. This was lying around at
work. No one wants it anyway. ”
</p><!--l. 28792--><p class="indent" >  Unpredictably, she smiles. “Cool.” She looks at him kindly for a moment and
disappears back into the kitchen where he hears her making tea. Then she re-emerges
in a moment with two not-so-clean looking mugs of hot tea. She sits down on
the sofa again and makes room for him with a subtle gesture. Clearly he is
expected to join her there; perhaps she is willing to try again to get him to
make his move. If that is what she really wants. If he is not misreading the
signs.
</p><!--l. 28800--><p class="indent" >  He sits down beside her, just centimetres away from her slight frame. God look at
her, he thinks. Such physical beauty, but such a blank and sour expression. What is the
matter with Norway, he thinks. Catch the eye of a beautiful woman and instead of
taking it as a compliment it is: ‘what are you looking at, ass-hole?&#x2019; He is not sure
whether women are ashamed of themselves, or perhaps embarrassed by real
interest. The only time he has seen someone responding to attention is after
half a bottle of spirits. Is it: don&#x2019;t fuck with me, because I am nothing and I
am already really pissed oﬀ about that!? Or is it: don&#x2019;t look at me because
you are nothing and I am not willing to put my judgement on hold until I
can no longer take responsibility for my actions and literally anyone will
do?
</p><!--l. 28813--><p class="indent" >  Dermot feels suddenly depressed, wondering why he has come here at all. Clearly
he is not getting anywhere. She is not interested in him, but she has some magnetic
quality. He has fallen into a trap; the madness has struck him down again. There is
something about her that is vulnerable and tender, that makes him want to stay and
look after her. But he knows enough to know that there is nothing here that he can
possibly look forward to.
</p><!--l. 28821--><p class="indent" >  They are sitting tight, but he cannot bring himself to go one step further. What the
hell is it she wants? He looks down at her legs from the corner of his eye and wishes
that he could make love to her tenderly.
</p><!--l. 28826--><p class="indent" >  “I got my injection today,” she says.
</p><!--l. 28828--><p class="indent" >  “Injection?”
</p><!--l. 28830--><p class="indent" >  “Contraceptive. I hate pills. And condoms. You spend so much time ﬁddling with
them that you lose the moment.”
</p><!--l. 28833--><p class="indent" >  He prepares himself for a beating. “I thought you weren&#x2019;t interested in sex?” he
reminds her.
</p><!--l. 28836--><p class="indent" >  She shrugs and avoids the question. “I might want to try it.”
</p><!--l. 28838--><p class="indent" >  Is she ﬂirting with me, he wonders. This is so typical her. She does not look at him
or give any sign of being interested and yet she presents him now with this revelation
as though he is supposed to know what it signiﬁes.
</p><!--l. 28843--><p class="indent" >  “You know, after I had my kid I wanted to know what it would be like to have sex –
you know, whether I would be able to feel anything, or if it would be any diﬀerent
from before. So I went out to a place where I used to hang out and play pool to see if I

could pick someone up. And I kept hanging around this guy. He wasn&#x2019;t interested in
me at all. We were playing pool and stuﬀ and all of his friends thought I was some
kind of loser.”
</p><!--l. 28851--><p class="indent" >  Dermot listens but can hardly believe his ears.
</p><!--l. 28853--><p class="indent" >  She continues. “In the end it was just the two of us and he still wasn&#x2019;t interested but
I wouldn&#x2019;t leave him alone. So we come back here really late and he is really tired and
really drunk. And we start doing it. And he is really rough, shagging me really
hard. And he couldn&#x2019;t come. It took him ages. I thought he would never stop.
I was just lying there wishing he would be ﬁnished. The day after I could
hardly walk. In the end he just pulled up his pants and left. He didn&#x2019;t even say
anything.”
</p><!--l. 28862--><p class="indent" >  Dermot&#x2019;s feels panic rising throughout the story – he feels physically sick. His heart
is pounding and he feels adrenalin surging through him. He is crushed. There is an
instinct within him that ignites a pressing urge to ﬂee. He dares a look at her and sees
that she is suppressing that fact the she was hurt. But her face is the same stoney statue
of perfection, devoid of feeling.
</p><!--l. 28869--><p class="indent" >  How can girls who are so fragile invite such danger? his mind protests. He imagines
of her under some utterly drunken, violent low-life and it makes him physically
nauseous.
</p><!--l. 28873--><p class="indent" >  He tries to pull himself together. Wouldn&#x2019;t he do the same thing if he got the
chance? Would he? Well, not like that .. or? It really is not the same for a girl
to sleep around as it is for a guy. Girls have to submit to the unknown – to
potential danger. They are more helpless in sex than men. It is nothing to do with
disease. It is the threat of abuse, of physical danger. The idea of being able
to feel safe opening yourself to someone is not something that Dermot can
understand.
</p><!--l. 28881--><p class="indent" >  And even psychologically – men are just spreading something around,
disseminating, but a woman with several partners is collecting something, collating. It
is diﬀerent, whatever it means.
</p><!--l. 28885--><p class="indent" >  He would like to think that men were not chauvinistic pigs as per the rumours, but
he cannot genuinely say that it is not true. It is his reluctant estimation that most males
are really self-serving, callous bastards who use girls without any regard for their
feelings But why do women allow it? Even seek it out?
</p><!--l. 28891--><p class="indent" >  He is shell shocked. He does not know what to say. Suddenly she jumps up and
goes to the shelf by the combo. “Look what I have left.” She picks up a bottle of
Scottish whisky. “You want a glass? We can celebrate you ﬁxing my combo.” She is
suddenly light hearted now. Dermot simply feels grateful for the oﬀer of a swig of
something this will calm his nerves. She ﬁlls two small glasses and pushes one into
his hand. ”Here. Skål!”
</p><!--l. 28899--><p class="indent" >  They drink.
</p><!--l. 28901--><p class="indent" >  She ﬂips channels again and ﬁnds a movie that looks okay. It is clear that she does
not want him to go, but has given up any thought of sex. He, for his part,
does not feel in a ﬁt state to leave. He is drawn to her, even though he knows

that she will cause him enormous grief. So they sit and watch the movie,
drinking whisky. As he is drawn into the fantasy of the ﬁlm, he is gradually
released from his earthly anxiety, still wondering what the hell it is that she
wants.
</p><!--l. 28910--><p class="indent" >  The combination of movie and whisky has a soporiﬁc eﬀect. Dermot even ignores
the incoming alerts on his mobile wrist strap. After the stress of the day it was
pure masochism to come here and expose himself to this heart wrenching. If
he were half as smart as his job description he would have realized what
was going on here and found himself a safer object of desire. Yet as they sit
here together, watching the movie they seem comfortable together. He feels
as though they have something, as though they are already a couple. Part
of him knows that he is a fool, but his primitive brain cannot help it. He is
ensnared.
</p><!--l. 28921--><p class="indent" >  The movie ends some time later, and his backside is going to sleep. Time to slip
away. She is asleep now, teasing him with her defencelessness. Lying this close to her,
she looks so calm so beautiful. No muscle tone in her soft face. He wants so badly to
reach out and take advantage of the situation, while she is helpless, but then he would
be everything he despises in others. And he knows that the only reason he is here at all
is that she knows he won&#x2019;t.

<!--l. 28935--><p class="indent" >  “Wait a minute,” he says. “Why are we so stupid?”
</p><!--l. 28937--><p class="indent" >  “What?”
</p><!--l. 28941--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t you see? Christmas is something that still pushes people&#x2019;s buttons. It sends
them running back to their families to dance around stupid trees and shit. Maybe that
is what we can use to recrystallize the larger groups.”
</p><!--l. 28946--><p class="indent" >  “You mean the traditional message of Christmas cheer, lots of love Santa
Claus.”
</p><!--l. 28949--><p class="indent" >  “Like Scrooge,” he thinks aloud and laughs.

</p><!--l. 28956--><p class="indent" >  Dermot has to think hard. “Mince pies,” he says and adds: “Have you ever been to
England?”
</p><!--l. 28959--><p class="indent" >  “You mean steak and kidney pies?”
</p><!--l. 28961--><p class="indent" >  “No. Mince pies, but not meat. I mean it&#x2019;s a fruit mixture called mincemeat. I don&#x2019;t
know why really. It&#x2019;s all kinds of leftovers of fruit mixed up and left to ferment. The
result is amazing. Mince pies.”
</p><!--l. 28968--><p class="indent" >  “All right, so how do we send the message of Christmas into the game?”
</p><!--l. 28970--><p class="indent" >  He grins happily. “We make it snow.”

</p><!--l. 28998--><p class="indent" >  The bar is more or less empty, and Joe has forsaken his new jeans for a pair of beige
slacks and a brown shirt, under his anorak. Back to old habits. Chocolate colours and
clichéd styles. Today, Joe looks like a Christian missionary. What happened to
Africa&#x2019;s burgeoning fashion industry?
</p><!--l. 29005--><p class="indent" >  “You know the latest? The American group has bought our youth organization. It&#x2019;s
going to be taken over by the Methodist church of Atlanta.”
</p><!--l. 29009--><p class="indent" >  “Nice.”
</p><!--l. 29011--><p class="indent" >  ”I have to go and meet them.”
</p><!--l. 29013--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s why you&#x2019;re looking so stylish today.”
</p><!--l. 29015--><p class="indent" >  Joe grunts as he sips at his beer. “And something else.”
</p><!--l. 29017--><p class="indent" >  Jonas raises an eyebrow.
</p><!--l. 29019--><p class="indent" >  “We were raided by police yesterday.””
</p><!--l. 29021--><p class="indent" >  “Really? What happened?”
</p><!--l. 29023--><p class="indent" >  “Terror alert.”
</p><!--l. 29025--><p class="indent" >  “Terror alert? Muslims?”
</p><!--l. 29027--><p class="indent" >  He shakes his head. “Christians. They&#x2019;ve been buying just about everything that
plugs straight into the psyche. Then they can stick their corporate logo onto it and
claim the authority of Jesus Christ.”
</p><!--l. 29032--><p class="indent" >  “Jesus Christ,” Jonas agrees and gulps his beer.
</p><!--l. 29034--><p class="indent" >  It feels good to be hiding out with Joe in this bar. The past couple of weeks has
been intense to the point of exhaustion. Jonas&#x2019; lack of self-control has made the issue
of the diversion of research funds into a national news item. Some even think that
international news agencies have taken an interest in the story. The furore has been
building and he is becoming inundated with requests for interviews and comments.
Perhaps this was not strictly what he intended, but it bears a certain moral
justice.
</p><!--l. 29042--><p class="indent" >  “You know, it got me thinking. The policeman who coordinated the arrest when you
were being followed. He said something about these vigilante groups originating in

youth groups and centres. Kids of around eighteen who are looking for their purpose
in the world. I started asking questions around some of the kids who spend a lot of
time on the net.”
</p><!--l. 29049--><p class="indent" >  “And?”
</p><!--l. 29051--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t know. Some of them might even come from our group.”
</p><!--l. 29053--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t you wish you had that research money now?”
</p><!--l. 29055--><p class="indent" >  Jonas drinks a slug of beer and looks around the bar. He likes to see the art and the
rows of bottles on the shelves, even if he never tastes any of it. Old beery habits die
hard. A few more people in the bar wouldn&#x2019;t hurt, as long as they were there to shield
them from attention rather than to demand their piece. None of the regular ﬁxtures are
here.
</p><!--l. 29062--><p class="indent" >  “Radical Islam or Christianity. The return to tribalism,” he philosophizes. “Kids
who are eighteen or nineteen, trying to understand the world. Angry and disowned.
Whether they come from the foothills of Kashmir or Setesdal, they are all ruled with
an iron ﬁst by elders who maintain the tribal traditions.”
</p><!--l. 29068--><p class="indent" >  “There are people out there just waiting to prey on kids of that age. You ﬁnd people
spreading out leaﬂets at Mosques and churches. Even at our group. I haven&#x2019;t
noticed it much fortunately, but I&#x2019;m sure it goes on. They are careful that
their spreading programs don&#x2019;t target people like me who could put a stop to
it.”
</p><!--l. 29074--><p class="indent" >  “These are dangerous times.” There is a certain exhaustion in his voice.
</p><!--l. 29076--><p class="indent" >  Joe continues. “The Evangelical Christians are tribalizing the south of the U.S. like
an industry now, and even here in parts of Scandinavia. They are isolating themselves
from the wider law, dealing with problems internally and ignoring the criminals
within their midst. People are in denial. Europe is becoming Africa, as Africa tries to
become Europe.”
</p><!--l. 29083--><p class="indent" >  Jonas laughs. “Africa? I never thought of it that way.”
</p><!--l. 29085--><p class="indent" >  Joe shrugs. “Sure, why not. The problem in Africa has always been that people will
not rise to the challenge of helping each other out of poverty. They think
small. They don&#x2019;t trust government. Government has been the enemy for so
long, so tribalism persists. If you don&#x2019;t have a sense of wider civic duty, how
can you create a civil society? Basic services, impartial administration. .
.”
</p><!--l. 29092--><p class="indent" >  Good to see Joe has not forgotten his intellectual heritage in working with these
kids, Jonas thinks. Youth centres need people like him with a smarter version of
reality than they normally oﬀer. If people can just get past ﬁguring out which
gang to belong to, it might be possible to save society from the breakup it is
experiencing.
</p><!--l. 29098--><p class="indent" >  “Are you going to stay on at the youth centre?”
</p><!--l. 29100--><p class="indent" >  “Not sure I can.”
</p><!--l. 29102--><p class="indent" >  “They want to get rid of you?”
</p><!--l. 29104--><p class="indent" >  “No. They want me to stay, but I can&#x2019;t swallow this new style of leadership. At the
same time, I don&#x2019;t want to abandon the kids.”

</p><!--l. 29107--><p class="indent" >  “What do they have in mind for it?”
</p><!--l. 29109--><p class="indent" >  “More like a church community with prayer meetings and preaching.”
</p><!--l. 29111--><p class="indent" >  “I suppose that&#x2019;s what they do.”
</p><!--l. 29113--><p class="indent" >  “Missionaries do not have to spread their doctrine as part of their work. We have
always tried to keep that part of the church out of the centres. We want people to think
for themselves. Most of them are there precisely because others have been doing their
thinking for them, in the ﬁrst place.”
</p><!--l. 29119--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s your French education showing through.”
</p><!--l. 29121--><p class="indent" >  “Liberté, egalité, fraternité? It&#x2019;s not politics either.”
</p><!--l. 29123--><p class="indent" >  “You know what they say. Religious leaders, are just politicians in dresses.”
</p><!--l. 29126--><p class="indent" >  “They say that?”
</p><!--l. 29128--><p class="indent" >  “Apparently.”
</p><!--l. 29130--><p class="indent" >  “It doesn&#x2019;t have much to do with the spirit anymore. People don&#x2019;t think that God is
listening, maybe.”
</p><!--l. 29133--><p class="indent" >  “Cause God never got himself a mobile. . .”
</p><!--l. 29135--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t laugh, Jonas.”
</p><!--l. 29137--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m not laughing. I am saying it is what you can expect if you place all your
hope in someone else. People have to take responsibility for themselves. It&#x2019;s
just no good to palm oﬀ the responsibility on someone else or something
else.”
</p><!--l. 29143--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re here, getting drunk?”
</p><!--l. 29145--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re here, getting drunk.”
</p><!--l. 29147--><p class="indent" >  “Too many people, just falling apart. You can see them one moment working well
in some niche of society, getting along, playing their role. Then something changes
and they cannot adapt.”
</p><!--l. 29151--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">We don&#x2019;t make kids that can adapt any more. They are too protected, too factory</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">moulded. They learn one thing – just one thing and when they are no longer needed,</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">they get thrown on the garbage pile. A pile of wasted humanity, sustained with pain</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">and reality killers.</span>
</p><!--l. 29156--><p class="indent" >  Jonas drinks from his own glass.
</p><!--l. 29158--><p class="indent" >  “You know, I&#x2019;ve seen kids <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">age </span>from twenty-seven to forty-something in just a year.
Youth vanishes in an instant. I&#x2019;ve seen it many times. The girls get thin and
starve, then they get help and they get fat and red, with high blood pressure.
Skin creases and bulges. They end up at the centres. Lost, helpless. We try
to remind them about how to live in a society, except it&#x2019;s not a society this
thing you have here. It&#x2019;s a machine now. And if you don&#x2019;t ﬁt in, you are just
replaced by a new part, not repaired. People are just components to be replaced
here.”
</p><!--l. 29168--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Good intentions fraught . . .</span>
</p><!--l. 29171--><p class="indent" >  Joe studies his distant expression. “Do you think I am too weak? Do you think that
I should just pick up and move on – go somewhere else and start again? Or should I
stay and ﬁght, like you?” He points to a newspaper. “They are advertising that now.
Kids call it rebooting. You do a reset on your life. Move somewhere, start

again.”
</p><!--l. 29178--><p class="indent" >  “Why run away?”
</p><!--l. 29180--><p class="indent" >  “Is it running away? Or is it seeking adventure?”
</p><!--l. 29182--><p class="indent" >  “If you need to ask I think you know the answer.”
</p><!--l. 29184--><p class="indent" >  Joseph regards him with his powerful black features and penetrating eyes. “Jonas,
look at all you have done. You have achieved far more than I ever have. Every time I
look at you, something has changed. You have achieved something and that is
good.”
</p><!--l. 29189--><p class="indent" >  Jonas laughs. “What have I done?”
</p><!--l. 29191--><p class="indent" >  “Your research. Knowledge, learning.”
</p><!--l. 29193--><p class="indent" >  “No. . . I think that&#x2019;s has all collapsed.”
</p><!--l. 29195--><p class="indent" >  “You have something to show for your work. A legacy.”
</p><!--l. 29197--><p class="indent" >  “What use is it now? The politics of the day are saying that knowledge and research
are pointless.”
</p><!--l. 29200--><p class="indent" >  “People always try to take advantage and knock you down.”
</p><!--l. 29203--><p class="indent" >  “This is the story of the Tower of Bullshit? And all the men did perish? No, I am
not trying to build anything. I am a plumber, Joe. I spend most of my time ﬁxing
things. But I would love to build something again.”
</p><!--l. 29208--><p class="indent" >  “So would I.” Joseph reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a chain. Hanging
on the chain is a small ﬁgure made of wood. “Look. I wanted to give you
something.”
</p><!--l. 29213--><p class="indent" >  “Give me something?”
</p><!--l. 29215--><p class="indent" >  “I got this when I was a child. I kept it because I thought it was a powerful image.”
he says. “Now I would like you to have it.”
</p><!--l. 29218--><p class="indent" >  “Me? But why? Don&#x2019;t you want to keep it?”
</p><!--l. 29220--><p class="indent" >  “For a heathen, you are one of the most spiritual people I know, Jonas. I would like
you to have it.” He dismisses Jonas&#x2019; sceptical expression. “Don&#x2019;t worry, it is not a
Christian thing. It&#x2019;s from the old religions of the west of Africa. Did you know that the
banks of the Niger were one of the few civilizations of the world that were not
hierarchically organized? No pyramid of power. Just distributed cooperation of small
groups.”
</p><!--l. 29228--><p class="indent" >  “I. . .eh. . .did know, yes. That&#x2019;s very kind of you . . . but what have I done to
deserve a gift? And such a precious one?”
</p><!--l. 29231--><p class="indent" >  “Just a little ju-ju between friends.”
</p><!--l. 29233--><p class="indent" >  He smiles and stares at the piece to conceal his embarrassment. How does one
receive such a gift?
</p><!--l. 29236--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Graciously, of course</span>.
</p><!--l. 29238--><p class="indent" >  He shakes Joe&#x2019;s hand and thanks him again, certain that he does not deserve any
such gift. As an academic he has been persuaded to abandon the pursuit of knowledge
to decide on funding policy. He has betrayed his roots. Even as a human
being, he is far from angelic in his attitudes or accomplishments. Kaja would
laugh at him know if she knew of this exchange. If he is so great, what is he
doing hiding out here in a brown bar in the middle of the city, looking for

cardiovascular relief in a glass of beer, instead of standing up to the hawks of
government?
</p><!--l. 29247--><p class="indent" >  Jonas looks down the long bar to where the old drunk usually hangs onto the
woodwork, not talking to anyone, just downing his beer. He is not there today, not yet.
Then a thought strikes him.
</p><!--l. 29252--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Has Joe lost his faith?</span>
</p><!--l. 29254--><p class="indent" >  Jonas&#x2019; eyes looks deeply into his dark friend&#x2019;s face, as if searching for the meaning
of this development. Joe seems to be happy staring into his beer for a moment, and
Jonas feels suddenly tired and worn.
</p><!--l. 29258--><p class="indent" >  It reminds him of something. His life seems to roll past him, as if on ﬁlm and he
sees something that he should have seen a long time ago. He stares back at the space
on the end of the bar, where the old drunk usually hangs out. Where is that loser?
Where is that sad old fuck who comes here to avoid company and drown his
sorrows?
</p><!--l. 29264--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">It&#x2019;s me</span>, he thinks. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I am that sad old fuck.</span>
</p><!--l. 29266--><p class="indent" >  Just give me a beer and let me stagger home alone.
</p><!--l. 29269--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Where did it go wrong?</span>
</p><!--l. 29271--><p class="indent" >  It is possible to do everything right and still fail?
</p><!--l. 29273--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">It&#x2019;s you, idiot.</span>
</p><!--l. 29275--><p class="indent" >  He sees himself staring back from the mirror.
</p>
<div class="center"

<!--l. 29280--><p class="noindent" >
</p><!--l. 29281--><p class="noindent" >*</p></div>
<!--l. 29284--><p class="indent" >  Kaja&#x2019;s mother calls and asks him to be more helpful. His son needs him. What do
these people want from him? They profess to care but all they do is demand his
attention. They give him nothing in return, not even understanding. So why do they
hold on to him? Why won&#x2019;t they simply let him go?
</p><!--l. 29291--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Punishment at the hands of our loved ones</span>, Jonas thinks.
</p><!--l. 29293--><p class="indent" >  We are their chance to let down their barriers and let the ﬂood gates roar. An
understanding ear becomes a garbage chute for relief. No doubt he is partially to
blame, but what is it that makes them perceive each issue as a conﬂict, with points to
be won?
</p><!--l. 29299--><p class="indent" >  He can hear her voice even now. “You&#x2019;re so goddamn selﬁsh, Jonas. You buy me a
gift, but you don&#x2019;t get me anything I want. You buy something that you think I should
have. Have you never thought if my feelings? All you can see is your own precious
life.”
</p><!--l. 29305--><p class="indent" >  “And you see more?”
</p><!--l. 29307--><p class="indent" >  “Oh, so now it&#x2019;s my fault? That&#x2019;s typical!”
</p><!--l. 29309--><p class="indent" >  She will spend half the day just stewing in hormones, not getting anywhere, just
feeling confused and lost. There&#x2019;s not a chance of rational thought.

</p><!--l. 29313--><p class="indent" >  “Evenly happy for the rest of your life? How is that possible?”
</p><!--l. 29315--><p class="indent" >  “Do we really need these extremes?”
</p><!--l. 29318--><p class="indent" >  Then his secretary calls. “It&#x2019;s the girl I mentioned. She is still trying to get to you.
You should really take one of her calls, just to give her some satisfaction.”
</p><!--l. 29322--><p class="indent" >  “I know. I should.”
</p><!--l. 29324--><p class="indent" >  Sara is not to blame for this mess; she is still trying to reconcile the changes that
have taken place in such a short space of time with what she thought was the plan for
her future. Suddenly one ﬁnds oneself on a completely diﬀerent road, headed for the
unknown. He knows all about that.
</p><!--l. 29329--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I ought to call Sara, </span>he thinks. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I ought to call Kaja,</span>
</p><!--l. 29331--><p class="indent" >  He has been disinclined to call and discover who she is seeing at this moment in
time. That and all of the chaos of the past weeks seems to have disabled his sense of

</p><!--l. 29338--><p class="indent" >  Obviously because there are no barriers. The threshold for venting senseless
frustrations is too low. Everyone needs a valve, but that is no excuse for blasting our
nearest and dearest with bad-tempered steam.
</p><!--l. 29343--><p class="indent" >  Marriage was a release from all that, of course. It transformed the hard creativity of
romancing into a simple contract of obligations. Like the law itself: just an excuse to
stop thinking about how to behave well. Just follow the contract and you will be a
good person. But it didn&#x2019;t last either.
</p><!--l. 29349--><p class="indent" >  Well, he is not convinced. You cannot buy your future in a box, with a money
back guarantee. When you put a dog on a leash it is not generally for its own
good.
</p><!--l. 29353--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Joe has lost his faith.</span>
</p><!--l. 29355--><p class="indent" >  The revelation is like a lightening bolt from the Lord himself. Is the whole
world falling apart? Joe seems to be clinging on to the idea of it, but he has
already lost the battle? And the clothes—is that where the jeans come from?
Perhaps he cannot wear the fake garb of a would-be priest any more. He will
not say it, and Jonas can not ask him, but somehow they both understand
it.
</p><!--l. 29362--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Yes that&#x2019;s it.</span>
</p><!--l. 29364--><p class="indent" >  Jonas can see it. Joseph is too smart, too rational to be a religious man. His faith has
been shaken. He has asked the forbidden questions. But, for now, he is trying to
continue with his duties.

<!--l. 29386--><p class="indent" >  The man, the bureaucrat, has arrived. He swaggers around his department
like the town bully. The ministry has sent him to make sure that their plan is
enforced.
</p><!--l. 29390--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">His mandate is like my croissant, </span>Jonas thinks <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Layer upon layer of paper thin</span>
<span

</p><!--l. 29403--><p class="indent" >  Presumably they gave him this job to emasculate him. Vociferous researcher: too
smart for his own good, rein him in, neutralize by promotion within the ranks?
Control and regulate. The more they steam towards nominal de-regulation, the more
rules they implement to ‘guide&#x2019; its progress.
</p><!--l. 29409--><p class="indent" >  What remains of his scientiﬁc mind knows that it is useless of them to try, and
useless of himself to protest. You can&#x2019;t cage something that wild and still expect it
to live. It&#x2019;s like putting a rare animal in a zoo, or plucking and pressing a
beautiful ﬂower to have it. Life withers and dies in captivity. The more you try
to control it, the less of it is real. At the same time, you cannot argue with
denial.
</p><!--l. 29417--><p class="indent" >  Now, they are ready just to punish someone who has disobeyed government policy
for the good of the people. So, does all this protestation make him a terrorist? A
revolutionary? Robin Hood?
</p><!--l. 29421--><p class="indent" >  Jonas is right about his decision to oppose them: of that he is certain, but they have
puppies and kittens on their side. How can you argue against a humanitarian cause
and still use words like ‘ethics&#x2019;? Every conscientious person, with respect
for themselves, knows that you are supposed to preserve life in desperate
circumstances. How could one not spend money on the African famine? How could
selﬁsh and elitist research be of any use to mankind when there are people
suﬀering?
</p><!--l. 29429--><p class="indent" >  Apparently, preservation does not extend to investing in the survival of our whole
way of life: our future.
</p><!--l. 29432--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">We have become ﬁre-ﬁghters, and charity is a bucket of cold water in a growing</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">conﬂagration of politics.</span>
</p><!--l. 29435--><p class="indent" >  The sanguine bully that the ministry has sent to coerce him is regrettably pleasant in
his administration of their medicine, sporting joviality and an array of blunt
administrative instruments in his cause. Jonas does not want to force a dislike of

everything he represents onto its animated cadaver, but he ﬁnds himself projecting
more animosity than restraint. The man pretends to be their friend, but the charade
wears pretty thin.
</p><!--l. 29443--><p class="indent" >  “It is such a pleasure to ﬁnally meet you.”
</p><!--l. 29445--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I am about to hurt you.</span>
</p><!--l. 29447--><p class="indent" >  “As you know, some new rules have come into force.”
</p><!--l. 29449--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I just cut oﬀ your head.</span>
</p><!--l. 29451--><p class="indent" >  Jonas has the sick feeling of being railroaded by a cattle herder with no ethical or
moral manifesto. His interest is purely in moving up the food chain, by shifting the
economic game pieces around the board so that government ministries can feel good
about their half-assed pledges to the media.
</p><!--l. 29457--><p class="indent" >  “We all need a little breathing room from this reallocation. A little slack in
the rope, so it doesn&#x2019;t strangle us,” Jonas tells him, as nicely as he can. “It
is wrong of the ministry to make this decision that will kill oﬀ Norwegian
research.”
</p><!--l. 29462--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s a shame,” he agrees. “But it is what has been decided.”
</p><!--l. 29464--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">It&#x2019;s a sham, you mean.</span>
</p><!--l. 29466--><p class="indent" >  He is just following orders.
</p><!--l. 29468--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Soldier, ask not.</span>
</p><!--l. 29470--><p class="indent" >  Jonas recalls Ed Bishop&#x2019;s comment about democracy: people have to go along with
the decisions once they have been made. Does that mean he being undemocratic in
this behaviour? Let&#x2019;s face it, no one was asked to vote on this decision. It was a
unilateral action. The government is betraying its people with its indolent and supine
acceptance of commands that don&#x2019;t even come from an agent of any country or
people. This is direct pressure from American, Christian lobbies. They represent
neither U.S. nor Norwegian policy. We ought to be viewing this travesty as an
inﬁltration of national security, not as a directive to be accepted with nauseous
servility.
</p><!--l. 29481--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Douse us in cheap guilt and change our whole economic strategy. Are we so</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">push-over?</span>
</p><!--l. 29484--><p class="indent" >  Jonas has still not come to terms with losing Sara. And losing her to the police of
all things. Since when did the forces of creative anarchy transfer to become part of the
sentinels of establishment? At least she has a home for the time being, and income.
She is a smart kid, but he needs to feel that he has done more to protect her from what
is going on.
</p><!--l. 29491--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">All our futures lie in the hands of people like her.</span>
</p><!--l. 29493--><p class="indent" >  So he returns to the business of making his conscience feel better. He fends
interviews with journalists who have caught wind of the scandal he has leaked. Now
his minder is there to keep him in check.
</p><!--l. 29499--><p class="indent" >  “Of course, we are deeply committed to solving this problem.”
</p><!--l. 29501--><p class="indent" >  After the day&#x2019;s interviews, Jonas feels spent and hollow. Reiterating his own
message so many times, he is not even sure that he believes it himself anymore. His
scientiﬁc training makes him suspicious of any ‘truth&#x2019; that trips oﬀ the tongue. He

pulls one of the journalists to one side.
</p><!--l. 29507--><p class="indent" >  “In reality, we are not free to make these decisions. The ministry has put both
sides in shackles. I can try to resist those forces and they can try to push
them, but there has to be a point of balance in the middle. Luckily, their own
system is preventing such a rapid change from taking place. You cannot force
the bureaucratic leviathan you have created to be ﬂexible when it suits your
needs.”
</p><!--l. 29514--><p class="indent" >  “Would you agree that corruption is so ingrained into the daily lives of
government that they really cannot see anything wrong with what they are
doing.”
</p><!--l. 29518--><p class="indent" >  “Only in an academic sense. Any hierarchy of command is, by deﬁnition, corrupt
and self-serving, but let&#x2019;s not exaggerate.”
</p><!--l. 29521--><p class="indent" >  Now he has received a number of calls and threats from oﬃcious persons at the
ministry, suggesting that he could be arrested for treasonous behaviour if he continues.
He wonders if they could they set the crime team onto him now, with his new friends
at Interpol?
</p><!--l. 29526--><p class="indent" >  He ﬁnds himself becoming impatient with the process, approaching a point at
which he must decide whether or not to allow himself to become angry, or whether to
suppress the urge and maintain his equanimity.
</p><!--l. 29531--><p class="indent" >  He has disturbed a lot of people today, including himself.
</p><!--l. 29533--><p class="indent" >  When he returns the next day, there is a memo from the chief administrator. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Mr.</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Lindgren, due to new construction renovation, we ﬁnd that we are in need of your</span>

<span

</p><!--l. 29549--><p class="indent" >  Jonas walks along Karl Johan, admiring the prosperity of the retailers and their
wares. It is good to see the world working, the wheels of fortune grinding on their
investments. It is good, even to see so many people out of their homes, simply
walking around. The power of Christmas is still strong. Some things never
die.
</p><!--l. 29555--><p class="indent" >  Designer drum beats pump out their own wares onto the shopping street, warming
the twilight chill with musical toddy. The rhythms seep involuntarily into his psyche,
defying his own reticence and teasing him to dance, as he has never actually been able
to do in his entire life. The producers are good; they know their trade. But he wonders
how much it costs kids to play it.
</p><!--l. 29562--><p class="indent" >  <span

</p><!--l. 29567--><p class="indent" >  Just thirty years ago, it was possible to buy recorded music and be done with. Now
everything is licensed by the hour.
</p><!--l. 29570--><p class="indent" >  A woman approaches who reminds him of Kaja, but knows immediately that it
could not be her. This woman walks at a calculated pace, on designer shoes
that cry out exhibitionism, prying distance between herself and the waves of
pedestrians that shuﬄe about her. That is not Kaja. He has been trying to reach
her for a whole day, but she has not been answering him. The tables have
turned.
</p><!--l. 29577--><p class="indent" >  Jonas browses the shop windows, looking at the electrical goods for inspiration.
They are all foreign, even now. If he were allowed to do his job, some of
these could be Norwegian. If he could only convince government to reform
their attitudes to risk and investment. If the country is to survive the next
generation with declining oil revenues, it will have to innovate, not merely
import, even if it means manufacturing. But the country is barely trained for it.
Education is little more than attitude engineering and button pushing now. The
house-of-cards economy is still buoyed by fossil fuels and fossilized ideas. Sooner
rather than later that wealth must expire and be replaced by something more
permanent. His job is about securing that permanency, if only they could see
it.
</p><!--l. 29590--><p class="indent" >  A gang of teenage boys comes along the street, wearing red and silver tinsel like
football scarves. Did they bother going to school today? A couple of police on
horseback are clopping along behind them, at a discrete distance. The sight of
uniforms take his mind back to Sara.
</p><!--l. 29596--><p class="indent" >  He has walked more or less all the way around the shops now, as the daylight has
faded. With the long nights moving in, he feels tempted to simply go home and sleep,
but it is only four o&#x2019;clock. He should work some more. If he goes home, it would
become a self-fulﬁlling prophesy.
</p><!--l. 29602--><p class="indent" >  Jonas backtracks and goes into a little shop to buy coﬀee. Simple pleasures are
what carries you through the hard times. Besides, the shop is unusually quiet, which
suits him perfectly.
</p><!--l. 29606--><p class="indent" >  He chooses the appropriate blend of beans and asks for them to be ground. The
lighting inside the shop makes it look even darker outside now. The bluish hue of
evening is descending rapidly. He gives his card to the young boy behind the counter
and waits for him to deal with the transaction.
</p><!--l. 29612--><p class="indent" >  Then, through the window, even through the reﬂections, he sees her across the
street. It is Kaja.
</p><!--l. 29615--><p class="indent" >  She emerges from a side alley between two shops, smiling and laughing. Behind
her is a man he does not know. He head is thrown back joyfully. The man is some
years older than she. Jonas is suddenly impatient to complete his purchase and see
where she is going.
</p><!--l. 29620--><p class="indent" >  He feels a stab of something undeﬁnable, something like betrayal but more violent.

Is it jealously or anger? What does it matter? His every muscle pulls taut with a
surging scream and he begins to shake with the adrenalin rush. Of course she would
not answer him if she had spent the entire night and day with a new lover. How could
he have been such a fool?
</p><!--l. 29627--><p class="indent" >  When he emerges clumsily from the shop, she is already far down the street. He
begins to run after her, not wanting to be seen, but not wanting to lose sight of her
either.
</p><!--l. 29631--><p class="indent" >  Are they lovers? They must be! He is not an attractive man, but then Jonas has
never understood what turns women on. The thought of her in bed with him burns like
an ice-water ﬂooding into his lower body.
</p><!--l. 29635--><p class="indent" >  He follows them for some distance, back to her apartment feeling a mixture of guilt
for his intrusive voyeurism and anger at her callous mind games.
</p><!--l. 29639--><p class="indent" >  She clasps the man as though they are about to part company. But then they pause.
Some new possibility seems to have emerged between them. He follows her
inside.
</p><!--l. 29643--><p class="indent" >  This is so like her, he thinks. And what a fool is he, who falls for her promises and
assurances every time? He has been proven the fool time and time again. What
possession drives him to prevaricate in ending this charade?
</p><!--l. 29647--><p class="indent" >  It could be true that people need change about every ten years. The timer starts
ticking and we either we change or we enter into an emotional crisis. Those who
marry at twenty learn it when they are thirty; those tho change jobs when they are
thirty learn when they are forty. . . What hope is left except to accept stagnation? To
make peace with endings?
</p><!--l. 29654--><p class="indent" >  Their end was like a fabled nightmare: telephone calls that she would ignore in his
presence and then ﬁnd an excuse to return later; visits from ‘old friends&#x2019; and
ex-boyfriends; her increasing lack of interest in him. Finally the signs could not be
ignored and his fears consumed him in a rain of presumed truths, like a stoning from
the inquisition.
</p><!--l. 29660--><p class="indent" >  In the chill, it begins to snow.

<!--l. 29666--><p class="indent" >  Jonas crawls back to the oﬃces the next day, still feeling like a wounded animal. He
has not spoken to anyone. He escaped the evening by throwing oﬀ his shoes and
settling down with a glass of ﬁne Madeira and Honegger&#x2019;s grave symphonic
rumblings.
</p><!--l. 29671--><p class="indent" >  More snow is forecast today. That pleases him. Somehow, the snow seems to light
up the city with optimism. There is still something in that peace and goodwill to all
men nonsense, when it snows. Such a pity that it melts so quickly in the
city.

</p><!--l. 29676--><p class="indent" >  He nears the site of the neighbouring demolition that has been taken over for
parking spaces, and hears the protracted complaint of a motorist getting closer. The
man is trying to enter the parking area, but the security guard is explaining some kind
of problem.
</p><!--l. 29681--><p class="indent" >  “My parking space is taken.”
</p><!--l. 29683--><p class="indent" >  “Sorry sir, there is no reserved parking today.”
</p><!--l. 29685--><p class="indent" >  “But I work here. How am I, are we supposed to. . .”
</p><!--l. 29687--><p class="indent" >  “Sorry, sir. You cannot park you car in its reserved spot today, we are expecting
visitors from the ministry. They have reserved these spaces.”
</p><!--l. 29691--><p class="indent" >  “I wasn&#x2019;t told.”
</p><!--l. 29693--><p class="indent" >  “You can park in the unmarked spaces over there.”
</p><!--l. 29695--><p class="indent" >  “But how are we going to ﬁnd our vehicles again?”
</p><!--l. 29697--><p class="indent" >  “Just move along, sir. We don&#x2019;t have time to discuss this now.”
</p><!--l. 29699--><p class="indent" >  So the ministry is screwing with everyone&#x2019;s heads today. Somehow seeing someone
else&#x2019;s meaninglessly stunted predicament helps his own spirits. He refuses to believe
that the point of authority is to reduce ordinary people to powerless ignominy, but
sometimes it is a hard theory to refute.
</p><!--l. 29705--><p class="indent" >  Of course, when it snows later, you won&#x2019;t be able to ﬁnd the cars again, he thinks to
the guard as he walks past him. The guard stares through him to make it clear that he
is no one.
</p><!--l. 29709--><p class="indent" >  Jonas arrives at the research council oﬃces and walks unwillingly down the
corridor to the day&#x2019;s ritual humiliations. He would rather transport himself away from
here to help Sara, or ﬁnish his business with Kaja, but he wills himself forward with
cheerless eﬀort. He has no usable oﬃce to attend, but he can make use of the other
facilities the building oﬀers.
</p><!--l. 29716--><p class="indent" >  Things are moving in the research debate. Well, he wasn&#x2019;t going to stand still and
be steam-rollered by a minor minister, at least not without a ﬁght. His new spiritual
low incites him to make the matter international now. When one of the richest nations
faults on its responsibilities to its poorer neighbours, the matter goes beyond local
politics. Today, he feels like stabbing back.
</p><!--l. 29723--><p class="indent" >  Almost as soon as he has posted a commentary to a research magazine editorial, his
combo signals an unusual call invitation. At about the same time, he receives a text
from Joe, saying that he should expect a call.
</p><!--l. 29728--><p class="indent" >  He pushes aside some of the boxes from his desk, to make room to sit down. The
call is from Spain. Spain? He rummages around for some glasses and accepts the
invitation. He enters the virtual meeting room.
</p><!--l. 29732--><p class="indent" >  He ﬁnds himself on a balcony overlooking the sea. A slight sound of surf is audible.
It feels a little uncomfortable, sitting like this in his oﬃce. He has never been a great
fan of using glasses. The inconsistencies between vision, sound and touch make him a
little nauseous.
</p><!--l. 29738--><p class="indent" >  A woman is standing beside him, looking out at the breaking waves. She is slim and
attractive, with dark hair and a middle aged face, young and old at the same
time.

</p><!--l. 29742--><p class="indent" >  “My name is Connie Cortina,” she says. “I am executive director of a company
called Vascon.”
</p><!--l. 29745--><p class="indent" >  “Jonas Lindgren,” he reciprocates.
</p><!--l. 29747--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s nice to meet you, Dr Lindgren. I&#x2019;ve been following some of the debate, thanks
to a friend of yours.”
</p><!--l. 29750--><p class="indent" >  “Who? Joe?”
</p><!--l. 29752--><p class="indent" >  “Joseph, Joe, yes.” She exudes an elegance that Jonas ﬁnds charming. “I hope you
don&#x2019;t mind my interruption. I have been reading about about your struggles for
Norwegian research. I ﬁnd them very interesting.”
</p><!--l. 29758--><p class="indent" >  “Thank you,” he says, uncertain of what else to say. “What can I do for
you?”
</p><!--l. 29762--><p class="indent" >  “I wanted to lend you my support.”
</p><!--l. 29764--><p class="indent" >  “Your support?”
</p><!--l. 29766--><p class="indent" >  “Yes.”
</p><!--l. 29768--><p class="indent" >  Now he is perplexed. “What kind of support? How can you help me?” Then, he
adds: “Forgive me, I don&#x2019;t mean to be rude.”
</p><!--l. 29772--><p class="indent" >  She shakes her head, matter of factly. “Moral support to begin with. It
is hard work to go against one&#x2019;s own government. I wanted to talk to you
about my own experiences and perhaps lend you some of my thoughts on
this.”
</p><!--l. 29777--><p class="indent" >  “Are you for or against my writings?”
</p><!--l. 29779--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t think of it really in terms of sides. There is only one alternative for any
country—to survive.”
</p><!--l. 29782--><p class="indent" >  “What do you do?”
</p><!--l. 29784--><p class="indent" >  She considers her answer for a split second. “My company is a large concern. It
sponsors good-work projects in research and education. It is rather complicated
to explain why and how. Let&#x2019;s just say that I am always looking for allies
around the world. Those of us who believe in such things are few and far
between.”
</p><!--l. 29790--><p class="indent" >  Jonas laughs without humour. “That&#x2019;s interesting,” he says, unsure of how to
respond. “What kind of allies are you looking for?”
</p><!--l. 29793--><p class="indent" >  “People who can stand up to the storm and face the future, as you have done.” She
wants be his friend.
</p><!--l. 29796--><p class="indent" >  “Well, I am open to all kinds of input,” Jonas says. “But I&#x2019;m a little taken
aback.”
</p><!--l. 29799--><p class="indent" >  Cortina smiles at him and swishes her hair. “My company has many specialities, but
information is our business. I have a group that works with the police forces
of many countries to trace threads of crime and corruption. We have work
related to the global VR games. But, whenever I can I return to the issue of
education.”
</p><!--l. 29805--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t follow you.”
</p><!--l. 29807--><p class="indent" >  “An incident that you reported recently, related to a threatening phone
call was correlated by people working with our company, with data from

international police forces and our models put together a scenario that was very
interesting.”
</p><!--l. 29812--><p class="indent" >  He starts. “Me? How did you know? I&#x2019;m not sure I understand. I thought you were
talking about the research articles. . .”
</p><!--l. 29816--><p class="indent" >  “This is very complicated, señor Lindgren, but your police report formed a missing
link that allowed us to see connections in the patterns of behaviour across Europe. My
company specializes in this kind of analysis, and we work with Interpol to weed out
organized crime.”
</p><!--l. 29821--><p class="indent" >  “Maﬁa?”
</p><!--l. 29823--><p class="indent" >  “Not just the maﬁas. There are many players in the game. The report was useful
because it placed activities in this area close to others that were close to others. . .and
so on. We have expert modellers who put together hypotheses about organized
criminality.”
</p><!--l. 29828--><p class="indent" >  “This is all a bit confusing for me. I am new to this. I am not used to being so . . .
involved.”
</p><!--l. 29831--><p class="indent" >  “In this instance, we were able to use it to shut down the group who contacted
you.”
</p><!--l. 29834--><p class="indent" >  “You. . .? But I heard that . . . Can I ask who it was?”
</p><!--l. 29836--><p class="indent" >  “Just amateurs, associated with a Christian religious group from Eastern Europe.
They were not very smart, and that helped us to pin-point their identities. I doubt that
you will hear from them again.”
</p><!--l. 29841--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s amazing. I&#x2019;m a bit ﬂabbergasted.”
</p><!--l. 29843--><p class="indent" >  “Take a moment.”
</p><!--l. 29845--><p class="indent" >  “How can you know about this police business. Are you with the Interpol group
here?”
</p><!--l. 29848--><p class="indent" >  “I know of them.”
</p><!--l. 29850--><p class="indent" >  “But you&#x2019;re not working with them?”
</p><!--l. 29852--><p class="indent" >  “No, but our company is very powerful. We develop the systems used by the police
forces and we donate some funds to them whenever we can.”
</p><!--l. 29855--><p class="indent" >  “And this gives you access to their data?”
</p><!--l. 29857--><p class="indent" >  “Exactly.”
</p><!--l. 29859--><p class="indent" >  “So, if I am hearing you correctly, then from this, you became interested in me,
here in backwater Norway?”
</p><!--l. 29862--><p class="indent" >  “Not really. At least not directly. It is just that the power of analysis, sometimes
brings you to places you do not expect, Mr Lindgren. That is why we do research,
no?”
</p><!--l. 29866--><p class="indent" >  “Yes. I&#x2019;m trying to remember that.”
</p><!--l. 29868--><p class="indent" >  “And so we come to the other matter.”
</p><!--l. 29870--><p class="indent" >  “Of course.”
</p><!--l. 29872--><p class="indent" >  “I started to look into your work, wondering if there were any deeper reason why
you were approached.”
</p><!--l. 29875--><p class="indent" >  “Was there?”

</p><!--l. 29877--><p class="indent" >  “Possibly. I don&#x2019;t think so. I&#x2019;m not sure. But I learned something of the dilemma
you are facing.”
</p><!--l. 29880--><p class="indent" >  “Any in particular?”
</p><!--l. 29882--><p class="indent" >  “You see I have several projects that I have made my work, and one of them is
ﬁghting ignorance.”
</p><!--l. 29885--><p class="indent" >  Jonas does not know how to respond. Conversations in the VR are hard to interpret.
The body language is primitive.
</p><!--l. 29889--><p class="indent" >  “Ignorance is not bliss,” he jokes.
</p><!--l. 29891--><p class="indent" >  “Not unless you are a radical Christian activist,” she parries.
</p><!--l. 29893--><p class="indent" >  Jonas&#x2019; radar ﬂicks on. “Christian radicals. They seem to be cropping up everywhere
these days.”
</p><!--l. 29896--><p class="indent" >  “Yes they do, don&#x2019;t they?”
</p><!--l. 29898--><p class="indent" >  “But Joe. . .”
</p><!--l. 29900--><p class="indent" >  “You have a number of good projects in your research council proposals and they
are about to be turned over by a directive that comes from one of the most powerful of
these groups.”
</p><!--l. 29904--><p class="indent" >  He nods inside his glasses.
</p><!--l. 29906--><p class="indent" >  “I want to ask you not to allow these important projects to be displaced by a cheap
political gambit that your government is being coerced into.”
</p><!--l. 29910--><p class="indent" >  “It seems that I no longer have the power to make that decision.”
</p><!--l. 29912--><p class="indent" >  “Hold oﬀ as long as you can. This is a matter of importance.”
</p><!--l. 29914--><p class="indent" >  “What makes you say that?”
</p><!--l. 29916--><p class="indent" >  “This pressure to divert your funds is not based on a sound judgement. It could still
blow over. There are groups working against these organizations in several countries,
and on several fronts.”
</p><!--l. 29920--><p class="indent" >  He thinks of Sara, and Edward Bishop. “Yes,” he says. “Yes, I know.”
</p><!--l. 29922--><p class="indent" >  “The team you would send to the famine area will achieve nothing. That is not their
purpose. The aim is simply to delay progress in more important works. I know this to
be true.”
</p><!--l. 29927--><p class="indent" >  “But how?”
</p><!--l. 29929--><p class="indent" >  “Because I attended the meeting at which the decision was made.”
</p><!--l. 29931--><p class="indent" >  Jonas looks shocked. She cannot see his expression in the VR, but she can probably
guess from his silence.
</p><!--l. 29935--><p class="indent" >  “You were at the meeting?”
</p><!--l. 29937--><p class="indent" >  “Yes,” she says quietly. “It was a meeting of the game consortium in fact, but the
originators of the game are people with powerful friends and strong motivations.
Some of them are good and some of them are not so good.”
</p><!--l. 29942--><p class="indent" >  “Who?”
</p><!--l. 29944--><p class="indent" >  “Oh, the rich and the bad and the ugly. You know. People who still have power, but
are seeing it crumble in this new age of street gangs and mob wars. The famine aid is
just a cover. Money means nothing in this situation. What matters to them is that they
can exert control over society&#x2019;s thinkers.”

</p><!--l. 29951--><p class="indent" >  “It has always struck me as odd that, when one can simply eliminate billions of
dollars of debt, or that countries can continue to go on with budget deﬁcits the size
the U.S. has, that one would need famine relief from a source like research
money.”
</p><!--l. 29956--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, money doesn&#x2019;t exist. If you wipe out money, we still have everything except
for the ﬁnancial acrobatics that the banks perform. And when you realize that our
world is ruled by an enormous Virtual Reality game called the global economy, it
makes perfect sense. It is pure pinball based on a ﬁctitious scoring system.
Anyone can say: I don&#x2019;t care what my score is, at any time. The only real
consequence is that they piss oﬀ all the other players. But it doesn&#x2019;t change anything
real.”
</p><!--l. 29965--><p class="indent" >  “So when a government from one of the richest countries in the world comes and
tells you that you have to divert funds from research to famine relief, you know that
they are covering up something.”
</p><!--l. 29969--><p class="indent" >  “Exactly.”
</p><!--l. 29971--><p class="indent" >  Jonas feels a little stunned, numb in his seat. His hand knocks into one of the sheets
of plasterboard that they have ﬁlled his oﬃce with and it jars him back to disoriented
concentration.
</p><!--l. 29975--><p class="indent" >  “All right,” he says, taking some breaths. “All right.”
</p><!--l. 29977--><p class="indent" >  Ms Cortina gives him some time to think. Then she says: “But, of course, you are
asking yourself why.”
</p><!--l. 29980--><p class="indent" >  He nods.
</p><!--l. 29982--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Damn right.</span>
</p><!--l. 29984--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, tell me.”
</p><!--l. 29986--><p class="indent" >  “Well,” she treads carefully. “I wish I could tell you exactly why. I am not sure I
understand it myself.”
</p><!--l. 29989--><p class="indent" >  “But you have an idea? A theory?”
</p><!--l. 29991--><p class="indent" >  “Yes I do.”
</p><!--l. 29993--><p class="indent" >  “So?”
</p><!--l. 29995--><p class="indent" >  “The church leaders who are sponsoring this activity have seen a trend. They see
that people are getting dumber.”
</p><!--l. 29998--><p class="indent" >  Jonas laughs despite himself. “Getting dumber?”
</p><!--l. 30000--><p class="indent" >  “Yes. Society has been dumbing down for decades. They see this as an opportunity
to get back what they have lost to science over the years.”
</p><!--l. 30003--><p class="indent" >  “You are serious, aren&#x2019;t you?”
</p><!--l. 30005--><p class="indent" >  She nods. “Knowledge is religion&#x2019;s greatest enemy.”
</p><!--l. 30008--><p class="indent" >  “Because knowledge is subversive?”
</p><!--l. 30010--><p class="indent" >  “It is counter to the authority of the church.”
</p><!--l. 30012--><p class="indent" >  “Yes. . .”
</p><!--l. 30014--><p class="indent" >  “They locked up Galileo, had a go at Darwin. . .”
</p><!--l. 30016--><p class="indent" >  Cortina&#x2019;s ﬁgure comes closer to his, ﬁlling his vision.
</p><!--l. 30018--><p class="indent" >  “And you think society is getting dumber.” He nods. “Well, I can&#x2019;t disagree with
that.”

</p><!--l. 30021--><p class="indent" >  “It is an inevitable process. Perhaps it is even a phase that every civilization has to
go through.”
</p><!--l. 30024--><p class="indent" >  “Yes,” he thinks, not really agreeing with her, but the wheels and cogs of his mind
race with thoughts that he has had a thousand times, yet never quite assimilated into a
coherent jigsaw puzzle.
</p><!--l. 30028--><p class="indent" >  “When society learns, it begins with real hard-earned knowledge. It takes a long
time and a lot of sweat to acquire. Sometimes we have worked for years to achieve
it.”
</p><!--l. 30032--><p class="indent" >  She is talking about herself, Jonas thinks. This is a smart lady, however eccentric
she might be.
</p><!--l. 30035--><p class="indent" >  “Gradually,” she continues, “Knowledge becomes assimilated into our
consciousness at a deeper level. We begin to speak of it without the need to explain
or elaborate. We begin to take it for granted and see it as a part of who we
are.”
</p><!--l. 30040--><p class="indent" >  Jonas pulls himself back from his own thinking to follow her. “You mean society
takes it for granted.”
</p><!--l. 30043--><p class="indent" >  “Yes. Finally, that hard earned knowledge gets passed on to those who have not
toiled and struggled for it, to those who have not tasted the sweat on their
brows or the thrill of understanding; that is when we begin to disrespect it.
The knowledge becomes like a war veteran, something laughably caught up
in a past struggle. We reduce it to simpliﬁcations, to slogans and jargon,
perhaps even to Three Letter Abbreviations, whose stories and details we
have now forgotten. At that point, damage has occurred. Society has lost the
value of the knowledge. And a whole new generation must relearn it all over
again.”
</p><!--l. 30054--><p class="indent" >  She makes a eureka noise and freezes amoment. The background imagery in
the VR changes. She projects them into an image of the Los Angeles traﬃc
machine.
</p><!--l. 30058--><p class="indent" >  “Here,” she says. “Look at this traﬃc chaos. It speaks of miracles, Jonas.” She calls
him Jonas. “That so many careless, half-competent idiots can get behind the wheel of
such dangerous equipment, and not simply end up in a pile of torn metal, seems
astonishing, don&#x2019;t you think?. There is surely a lesson to be learned from
it.”
</p><!--l. 30065--><p class="indent" >  “What lesson?”
</p><!--l. 30067--><p class="indent" >  “That trained monkeys can do this task,” she says. “We are so proud of ourselves
for mastering this simple task, and yet it means nothing. It requires little skill that is
not merely the domain of our primitive brains.”
</p><!--l. 30072--><p class="indent" >  “It is mainly motor skill, yes,” he agrees, acknowledging the pun.
</p><!--l. 30074--><p class="indent" >  “The same is true for most things. Once the hard part of thinking up the inventions
is done, once the technology is in place, you don&#x2019;t need to be a great expert. You don&#x2019;t
need great precision or ﬁne control to make the world work. It is robust. There are
basic protective instincts built into humans that allow them to escape the most bizarre
of catastrophic ends. We don&#x2019;t need to be utter control freaks – things will

sort themselves out. We just need a little faith. That, of course, is what the
church relies on. What is truly surprising is that we advance – and that requires
conviction and concentrated eﬀort.” Her hands gesticulate with a passion.
“For all our reputed intelligence, we get by on nothing more than primitive
instinct for most of the time. And yet we have surpassed that reﬂex in our
creativity, in science and in art.” She shakes her head and continues more quietly.
“Now that we have created our lap of luxury, we must not fall asleep in it, like
Rumpelstiltskin.”
</p><!--l. 30093--><p class="indent" >  Jonas looks at her with admiration. He wishes he could see what she really looks
like. “You don&#x2019;t think you might be overstating things just a little bit?” Even as he
says it, he knows that she is right.
</p><!--l. 30097--><p class="indent" >  “No, Mr. Lindgren, I am not. I wish I were. But already the forces of trivial
economics and faith are dominating the behaviour of society.”
</p><!--l. 30100--><p class="indent" >  He cannot disagree with that. It&#x2019;s the paradox of the century.
</p><!--l. 30102--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">We&#x2019;re consumed by trivia so there&#x2019;s no room in our heads for expertise. At the same</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">time, we&#x2019;re so singular in our privacy that we cannot even mix the ingredients of a</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">half-baked society.</span>
</p><!--l. 30106--><p class="indent" >  “Society truly is becoming the proverbial ‘bewildered herd&#x2019;.”
</p><!--l. 30108--><p class="indent" >  “This dumbing down of society is not just about entertainment. It concerns our
most important institutions, our education, our subservience.” Jonas wonders how her
passion would sound if she were speaking in Spanish. “I am here partly because your
friend, Joe, is part of a group working against the kind of ignorance that some would
have us perpetuate.”
</p><!--l. 30115--><p class="indent" >  “The Get Smart programme. Yes. What ignorance, in particular, are you speaking
of?”
</p><!--l. 30118--><p class="indent" >  “Today it is the leaders.”
</p><!--l. 30120--><p class="indent" >  Jonas laughs now with genuine amusement.
</p><!--l. 30122--><p class="indent" >  Cortina laughs too. “Perhaps I am talking too much? It is a habit of mine.”
</p><!--l. 30125--><p class="indent" >  “Please continue. Our leaders. . .”
</p><!--l. 30127--><p class="indent" >  “Our leaders, yes. Well, you know, in our information society, it is not the leaders
who are the card holders anymore. In ancient times, in the days when Europe was a
melange of warring houses, it was a hierarchical society. The leaders and their aids
were the most educated persons and all they needed was obedience to carry out their
commands. They had their Machiavellis and others to advise them, but basically the
expertise was at the top.”
</p><!--l. 30135--><p class="indent" >  “But today the expertise is at the opposite ends of the tree.”
</p><!--l. 30137--><p class="indent" >  “Exactly. The roots are dying and the leaves prosper but for the fact that they are
shackled to their roots and their aids, the inﬂexible branches. Now they want to stop
that from changing, by stunting the leaves, by taking away from people the basic right
to be good at something, to succeed. The right for one person to be better than
someone else.”
</p><!--l. 30145--><p class="indent" >  “Hmm.” Jonas nods. “Everyone is equal until proven guilty.” He nods. “I know this
tendency. It has been around since the seventies here. It almost ruined our maths

education.”
</p><!--l. 30155--><p class="indent" >  “Before it was only the poor who had the luxury of ignorance. Now it is the
opposite. The rich and powerful—who can lead because they are already <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">ahead </span>in the
Western view of economics—are increasingly falling behind the curve required to
understand the world. This is dumbing down. Yet they retain the power to bludgeon us
with instruments beyond their understanding, simply because we all play the game of
money.”
</p><!--l. 30163--><p class="indent" >  “Welcome to my world.”
</p><!--l. 30165--><p class="indent" >  “It aﬀects everyone. We are simply closer to it.”
</p><!--l. 30167--><p class="indent" >  “So how do we change it?”
</p><!--l. 30169--><p class="indent" >  “I am asking you to take a stand. Norway has a history of standing up for moral
principles. I am asking you to do this now.”
</p><!--l. 30172--><p class="indent" >  “But you realize that I, too, am just a puppet of the government if they want me to
be?”
</p><!--l. 30175--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t believe it,” she says, shaking her head and piercing him with the shrewdness
of her gaze. “Whenever They make laws, they set traps for themselves. Use your
imagination.” She smiles. “You must think me slightly mad to come to you and say
such a thing; but, you must understand the reason.”
</p><!--l. 30181--><p class="indent" >  Jonas nods.
</p><!--l. 30183--><p class="indent" >  “In a sense, technology is a test for society. It enables us, allows us to cooperate,
use agriculture to feed millions, make tools for others, have division of labour. But
there is also a trap. We have moved from being a loosely-knit ﬂock of do-it-alls into a
tightly woven fabric of specialists.”
</p><!--l. 30189--><p class="indent" >  He nods, impatiently. “Yes. But we are killing oﬀ the specialists now. Now that we
need them.”
</p><!--l. 30192--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, you see it too. These specialist skills are of paramount importance to our
society. Once we have division of labour, there is no turning back. We no longer
possess all the skills to survive without our neighbours. If the electricity suddenly
were to go away, or the telephone suddenly refused to allow you to talk to the
producers of things, could you survive? We have seen what happens in the great
natural disasters that wipe out civil infrastructure. People become lawless and
opportunistic savages again—just as the poor areas of the U.S. we are seeing
now.”
</p><!--l. 30202--><p class="indent" >  He sees it. If trust in the delegation of responsibility breaks down, if the roles are
not carried out properly, the system itself breaks down, and no one can ﬁx it, because
they no longer have the skills to do anyone else&#x2019;s job.
</p><!--l. 30207--><p class="indent" >  Today, society is not just local, it is globalised to the point at which the entire world
could crash if a part of the system ceased to work. As the Romans were fond of
saying: society is never more than four meals away from anarchy. Perhaps <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">that </span>is what
killed the dinosaurs, Sara might say.
</p><!--l. 30213--><p class="indent" >  “So you see that we are committed to civilization. We cannot go back to a simpler
life, at least not without causing massive fatalities. But society is becoming lazy,
dumbing down. We have invented technology after technology that makes us

into passive, button-pushing servants of machinery, reducing real knowledge
to simplistic, searchable keywords. In a few years, the dumbing down of
school curricula will result in a consumer culture with no skills. When that
day comes, there will be no one to repair the machines, no one to save us
from the collapse. Without education, society is on a downward spiral to
disaster.”
</p><!--l. 30224--><p class="indent" >  Jonas stares at her, half seriously, half wishing that she had picked any
other day of the year to bring this to him. He cannot quite ﬁnd the words to
respond.
</p><!--l. 30228--><p class="indent" >  She examines his intensity, as if reading him. “Mr. Lindgren. I have been ﬁghting
for this belief for as long as I can remember. Sometimes when I lie down at night, I
feel that I am helpless against this tide, as if I am drifting on a restless ocean, with no
port in sight and no lighthouse to warn me of the rocks. And yet I think this: if
a group of philanthropic industrialists can produce a counter-force to this
senseless plundering of the globalized economy, then so be it. It is a fair
ﬁght.”
</p><!--l. 30237--><p class="indent" >  “In just a few years, the canvas of the world could be repainted,” he ponders. “Skill
is easily squandered, and not so easily regained.”
</p><!--l. 30240--><p class="indent" >  He looks about at the scenery, which has reverted to their seaside balcony.
</p><!--l. 30242--><p class="indent" >  “But, there is a chance: it is not certain that the government can bring about their
own plan. There are, in fact, rules and regulations that are getting in their way. Things
don&#x2019;t move as fast as they would like.”
</p><!--l. 30246--><p class="indent" >  “So you could delay it? Perhaps even stop it.”
</p><!--l. 30248--><p class="indent" >  “We&#x2019;ll see. It would be a funny irony indeed if the Norwegian state bureaucracy
were the ultimate barrier that prevented this plot from being implemented. Truly a
clash of the titans: the irresistible force meets the immovable object.”
</p><!--l. 30254--><p class="indent" >  She smiles. “I like the idea.”
</p><!--l. 30256--><p class="indent" >  “If I can tie things up in process for a while and distract from the issue, it might not
pass through the ministry for some time.”
</p><!--l. 30259--><p class="indent" >  “Politics is about timing. If you delay it, it could become unimportant to them.
They might even change their mind.”
</p><!--l. 30262--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, a change of context could mean a change of priorities, yes. Perhaps it would
even be possible to make them actively support research again with some kind of
advertising campaign..”
</p><!--l. 30266--><p class="indent" >  “This is what the game itself is about. This is why we are here.”
</p><!--l. 30268--><p class="indent" >  “A battle for the greatest cause.”
</p><!--l. 30271--><p class="indent" >  Jonas remembers where he is, in his overrun oﬃce, in the middle of a bureaucratic
tackle for a ball that no audience really cares for. If he hadn&#x2019;t invested so much
of his life in science and the people who do it, he might be less inclined to
put himself in the ﬁring line. But this is his moment. Fate has handed him
Excalibur and told him to save the world. He can at least try to save a few of its
souls.
</p><!--l. 30278--><p class="indent" >  “You should have met my student,” he says. “This is really all just the theory of

signals. She is an expert.”
</p><!--l. 30281--><p class="indent" >  “Then use her. Make people stand up for their survival.”
</p><!--l. 30283--><p class="indent" >  He can see himself as a knight. “A campaign to save education from the clutches of
theocracy.”
</p><!--l. 30287--><p class="indent" >  “Remember to use your greatest asset: thinking. If, like the politicians and
advertisers, you only paint in broad strokes, with a fat brush, you cannot go
into detail—you are an impressionist. You might be lucky and get some of
those details by chance, but your fortune is not in your hands. Wave a ﬂag,
pick a brand, sing an anthem. . . You need to be more speciﬁc to push the
buttons.”
</p><!--l. 30294--><p class="indent" >  “And I even have an idea how. . .”
</p><!--l. 30296--><p class="indent" >  “Our technology can help you. It was developed for searching for gene actions in
humans, but it allows us to trace the channels of cause and eﬀect in the actions of any
information system. It is very powerful, and it is being used by the international law
enforcement agencies already.”
</p><!--l. 30301--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s how you found me.”
</p><!--l. 30303--><p class="indent" >  “Yes.”
</p><!--l. 30305--><p class="indent" >  “So you can unwind the ecological web.”
</p><!--l. 30307--><p class="indent" >  “In a sense, yes.”
</p><!--l. 30309--><p class="indent" >  “A mixture of delay and de-stabilizing the current policy.”
</p><!--l. 30311--><p class="indent" >  He experiences a feeling of satisfaction as if something has been accomplished.
Remember the days when he was still a teacher, not just a bureaucrat? He used to
measure the success of his time by whether anything was communicated,
whether any deeper understanding was achieved, whether they had moved
forward.
</p><!--l. 30317--><p class="indent" >  “So, if you see a colour that is too strong in your landscape. . .”

conversation again. How it all makes sense to him.
</p><!--l. 30341--><p class="indent" >  As he passes the demolition parking, he stops and looks at the cars with momentary
surprise. It fades quickly into satisfaction and then laughter. Freshly fallen snow has

its reform of the education system. It will require a higher level of documentation and
quality control measures to make sure that the stupid academics are doing their job
properly, not just sitting around thinking. The ministry claims that kids are no dumber
than before, and that they will rise to the challenges of the new decade. This
diversion of research funds is a necessary and temporary step for humanitarian
ends.
</p><!--l. 30368--><p class="indent" >  Jonas continues, “We are beating up our thinkers, drowning them in the syrup of
administration and economic board games. The need for administration is viral. it is a
self-sustaining process. Adding more formalia is like putting an eagle into a jungle

</p><!--l. 30525--><p class="indent" >  Vibe is playing with the sims, toying with the characters like dolls in a doll house,
as if she would ever lay her ﬁngers on anything so prosaic. She prefers the challenge
of playing with real people who don&#x2019;t know when they are being manipulated, but
there is no one suitable in range.
</p><!--l. 30531--><p class="indent" >  Preeta is working her own magic, collaborating with Dermot on some private
channel that Vibe prefers to keep well out of. The guy is seriously weird or something,
but Preeta seems to like him, so who knows. There is certainly no accounting for taste.
Preeta has been unwinding the skein of intricacies in the information network and is
gradually showing Vibe how the patterns form. She has been learning at an impressive
speed, and they have grown together into a mutual admiration society of two. Several
long days have passed getting to know one another while working on this
problem.
</p><!--l. 30541--><p class="indent" >  Preeta feels like fate herself, tangling with the ley-lines of cause and eﬀect.
Something draws her mind back to that fanciful intersection from her journey:
the child and the ice-cream. What happened to that child? Has his destiny
been realized yet? Has he changed the world forever? Is there still some role
for him to play to make his diﬀerence to the future? And what about her
own role? Will she make any contribution to the world that yet remains to
be acted out? She does not <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">feel </span>fulﬁlled yet. That, at least, must be a good
sign?
</p><!--l. 30551--><p class="indent" >  All in all, for all their petty distractions and foibles and neuroses, the rag-tag team
has been working well together. They have come together as an unlikely,
if not unholy union, working remotely or closely as moods and neuroses
dictate. But they have made several strides of progress, thanks mainly to
high spirits. That has pleased Bishop, and attracted the attention of several
others.
</p><!--l. 30558--><p class="indent" >  Vibe has been talking to Dr Lindgren now and then and he has given her his time
with a willing struggle, lending her ideas and suggestions. He seems to have some

new hobby-horse that has inspired them along their current path of action. Based on
those teasing splinters and arrowheads, they are constructing a bow from which to
launch their weapon, out of the spinal curvature of their sagging postures. It is nothing
if not back-breaking sitting at these terminals, inspecting thousands of lines of
meta-code, hour after hour. Dermot is king at this task, however, whoever and
wherever he is.
</p><!--l. 30569--><p class="indent" >  “Dr. Lindgren is really going tooth&#x2019;n&#x2019;nail at this,” Vibe tells them, as they play. “He
reckons I might not have to give up my PhD after all, if he can get past this next few
weeks without letting dropping the reins.”
</p><!--l. 30574--><p class="indent" >  “Really?” Preeta lights up in sympathetic optimism.
</p><!--l. 30576--><p class="indent" >  “Actually, I have no idea,” she confesses. “But the thought is a good one, don&#x2019;t you
think.”
</p><!--l. 30579--><p class="indent" >  “Look on the bright side,” she nods. “It must be awful not knowing?”
</p><!--l. 30581--><p class="indent" >  She smiles. “I&#x2019;m getting better at living with it.”
</p><!--l. 30584--><p class="indent" >  A disturbance wells up in the darker girl&#x2019;s hind-brain. “Will you go back, if you
can?”
</p><!--l. 30587--><p class="indent" >  Vibe regards her without expression from the corner of her eye. “I&#x2019;ll think about it
when it happens. For now, I&#x2019;m having fun.”
</p><!--l. 30590--><p class="indent" >  Although she pretends not to notice, she senses the relief in the satellite bodies
around her. There is no denying that she has found a niche here that works for her and
for the others. It is as though she is the ﬁnal spark-plug that released the energy of this
little engine. They needed her, and she delivered. It is not often that one gets to be that
appreciated.
</p><!--l. 30596--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Maybe I&#x2019;ve been chasing dreams for too long.</span>
</p><!--l. 30599--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t underestimate the value of serendipity,” Preeta says. “It is also
possible to enjoy something that you haven&#x2019;t chosen yourself.” She says it with
a wink, but Vibe feels it as a slap in the face. Vibe looks back at her and
ponders.
</p><!--l. 30604--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Hmmm. You think you know me, eh?</span>
</p><!--l. 30606--><p class="indent" >  Perhaps she is right. It is not written on her birth certiﬁcate that she always has to
get her own way. Maybe it&#x2019;s okay to let someone else make the decision now and
then. It can still be the right one. She smiles at herself, at her own prima Donna
arrogance.
</p><!--l. 30611--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Look at it this way. If it works out for the best anyway, then you really did get your</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">own way, right?</span>
</p><!--l. 30615--><p class="indent" >  Nina has been hanging around them, watching and learning. She is the sorcerer&#x2019;s
apprentice, just starting as a student, but she has already found her two role
models. There is little she can do, with or without Mickey Mouse ears or a
pointy hat, but if enthusiasm were a key, then they would have enough of
them to build a piano from here to Mars and back. Mostly she runs back and
forth, watching the others at their work, oohing and ahhing. It bolsters their
egos and keeps them supplied with drinks. Vibe&#x2019;s casual characteristic of her
was that of a badly ﬁred rat, ricocheting helplessly about the walls of its

maze.
</p><!--l. 30626--><p class="indent" >  Not everyone is so focused, however. There are other issues in the mix of this little
group than the solution of Interpol&#x2019;s socio-computational puzzle for the betterment of
mankind. Vibe and Preeta have been colluding on their own projects. These two
stealthy ginger cats have been spending time looking after their own destinies,
scouting through the nooks and crannies of police databases. Just the previous night
they spent searching through the Interpol cobwebs, looking at what is known about
Kuala Lumpur; now they have now turned their attention to the Norwegian forces,
or rather one in particular. Vibe has missing property to recover, let&#x2019;s not
forget.
</p><!--l. 30637--><p class="indent" >  It is not demanding work, but it has a certain thrill about it. This is hardly why they
are here, and there might be questions asked if they are discovered. Fortunately,
security is lax on the inside. The police database was trivial to access. It did not take
long to ﬁnd Patrol Pussy Radmila Eva Salberg, otherwise known as Jotunheimen Beat
Bitch. She strutted her way down from the North or Norway; she has worked in
Narvik, Alta and now she has been in the National Park area for two years. If oﬃcial
photos are to be believed, she is a regular beam of sunshine. More like moonshine, by
Vibe&#x2019;s reckoning.
</p><!--l. 30647--><p class="indent" >  She is good for a certain amount of gossip and tall storytelling, but it is an
incidental pass-time.
</p><!--l. 30650--><p class="indent" >  “Never mind the beat bitch. Let&#x2019;s ﬁnd Frank,” Vibe shudders. He is, after all, her
best approach after this time.
</p><!--l. 30653--><p class="indent" >  “Frank what?”
</p><!--l. 30655--><p class="indent" >  “Not sure. Try them all.”
</p><!--l. 30657--><p class="indent" >  “Ah, here we are. Frank Grøndahl. He&#x2019;s kind of cute.”
</p><!--l. 30659--><p class="indent" >  Vibe ﬂashes her eyebrows. “Actually, yes.” Then a diﬀerent thought ﬂushes her
enthusiasm. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Can you ﬁnd Peter Green?</span>
</p><!--l. 30663--><p class="indent" >  How would she explain him?
</p><!--l. 30665--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Someone I&#x2019;ve sort of been obsessing over. Someone who tried to put his hand</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">up.</span>
</p><!--l. 30667--><p class="indent" >  Maybe better to let that one go. Can&#x2019;t keep hanging on to a dead duck, or whatever
the metaphor is in this situation.
</p><!--l. 30670--><p class="indent" >  “So what do you want to do?”
</p><!--l. 30672--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Why not just send a message to Frank. Kill two birds with one asteroid?</span>
</p><!--l. 30674--><p class="indent" >  “We write.”
</p><!--l. 30676--><p class="indent" >  She writes.
     <span 
class="ptmr7t-">Dear Frank, thanks for your kindness in looking after me during my stay in</span>
     <span

     <span

     <span 
class="ptmr7t-">the mountain rescue business. Your colleague seems to have conﬁscated my</span>
     <span

     </p><!--l. 30686--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmr7t-">So anyway, maybe see you next time I&#x2019;m in town. Do you ski?</span>

</p><!--l. 30689--><p class="indent" >  She examines her handiwork and nods. Leave the end hanging, ambiguous. That&#x2019;s
good. Get those male hormones popping.
</p><!--l. 30692--><p class="indent" >  Preeta looks at her new acquaintance with a head full of questions and thoughts.
Now is not necessarily the time to be asking them all, but one day she means to
unravel some of her mystery. How can someone like Vibe exist? Doesn&#x2019;t she feel
any sense of trepidation about tinkering with mechanics of the world? She
seems to juggle with the threads of cause and eﬀect as though they are her
playthings. And, around her, the world neatly falls into place. Of course, it
cannot really be true, and yet that is the unmistakable impression that she
leaves.
</p><!--l. 30701--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">And what of me? </span>Preeta wonders. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I have been a runner, not a ﬁghter.</span>
</p><!--l. 30703--><p class="indent" >  Part of her would like to emulate her new friend; another half knows that that is
not entirely possible. You cannot capture someone else&#x2019;s spirit and hijack it
for your own. She has seen people try, and the result is neither pretty nor
ﬂattering.
</p><!--l. 30708--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">She cuts a beautiful ﬁgure though.</span>
</p><!--l. 30710--><p class="indent" >  Vibe is narrower of frame than herself and has a boyish kind of charm
that makes her look both athletic and divine. No one could deny that she is
attractive at many levels. Every motion of her body seems animated, ﬁlled with
life.
</p><!--l. 30715--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I am a China doll by comparison</span>, she thinks. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Even with more make-up, I am less</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">attractive. Because there is no beauty inside me. I am wax.</span>
</p><!--l. 30719--><p class="indent" >  Knowing the reason does not necessarily bring catharsis, but modesty owes her at
least a return on her meager investment; she will call in the favour when her life has
shed some more its old skin. There is time yet for the future, and time to explore what
she really wants. Besides, if they continue to hang out, perhaps some of Vibe&#x2019;s magic
will rub oﬀ on her.

<!--l. 30730--><p class="indent" >  For the ﬁrst days of Advent, one might have been expecting angels to herald its
onslaught, but angels are the scum of the VR, not the glowing portents of new things
to come. Other creatures have abducted that role. And Preeta met some agents last
night. One in particular.
</p><!--l. 30735--><p class="indent" >  One of the succubi identiﬁed it, or vice versa, it&#x2019;s hard to tell. It calls itself Mary
Cheung and claims to be able to inﬂuence billboard advertising in certain
environments. She seems to want to help them. If true, this could be a major
breakthrough. Of course, no one has any idea whether she is legit&#x2019; but they have
managed to compute a strategy that can make use of her, but which does not depend
on her.

</p><!--l. 30742--><p class="indent" >  Did she appear of her own free programming, or did their own seeds sprout? They
will not have the answer to that for some time to come.
</p><!--l. 30745--><p class="indent" >  What is interesting is that this agent is also claiming something a little odd: that the
best way to achieve their goals might be through a programme of freewill and induced
thinking in the players. That seems to tally with Dr Lindgren&#x2019;s latest rantings. It seems
almost a little too good to be true. Vibe ran a factor analysis, using Preeta&#x2019;s new
software just in case someone has been pulling their sweet feminine legs. The agents
seemed legit&#x2019;.
</p><!--l. 30754--><p class="indent" >  So how do you start the world thinking? Mary Shelley&#x2019;s Frankenstein tried a
massive electric shock to the temples. Bea uses a cup of triple espresso ﬁlled to the
brim with sugar, as a potion barely ﬁt for consumption. Neither of these need go down
well with Amnesty International, or even the international power conglomerates.
What is needed is a yoghurt. A healthy new age alternative. Homoeopathic thought?
Nope, too dilute to be workable. This will be the new-new-age yoga of the mind.

</p><!--l. 30765--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t really care what we end up using this for,” Vibe relays to the room
as she chisels away on her digital sculptures. “It&#x2019;s just fun working on this
solution.”
</p><!--l. 30769--><p class="indent" >  “Do you think anyone will believe it? Do you think it will work the way we
planned?”
</p><!--l. 30772--><p class="indent" >  “You don&#x2019;t know until you try it. That&#x2019;s why we do it.”
</p><!--l. 30774--><p class="indent" >  She sees that Bishop looks pleased, and that is enough for the time being. As the
time rolls on, Vibe murmurs softly in her trance.
</p><!--l. 30777--><p class="indent" >  “So we&#x2019;re approaching doomsday now.”
</p><!--l. 30779--><p class="indent" >  “Yup.”
</p><!--l. 30781--><p class="indent" >  “Where&#x2019;s the pimp? Where are our beauties?”
</p><!--l. 30783--><p class="indent" >  “Dermot has promised us a last-minute miracle.”
</p><!--l. 30785--><p class="indent" >  She turns her head away from her screen for a moment. “Do you think he&#x2019;ll
deliver?”
</p><!--l. 30788--><p class="indent" >  Preeta nods. “Yes.” Then she adds: “If he doesn&#x2019;t, I&#x2019;ll not make him mince pies for
Christmas.”
</p><!--l. 30791--><p class="indent" >  “Mince pies, eh?”
</p><!--l. 30793--><p class="indent" >  “Mince pies.”
</p><!--l. 30795--><p class="indent" >  “You hussy.”
</p><!--l. 30797--><p class="indent" >  The days and nights run into one another in the failing light of Oslo&#x2019;s impending
winter, and the group seems to be heading for a conjunction of physical and mental
concentration. Even Jonas Lindgren has made the eﬀort to come and see their work in
person, to impute the values of science to the champagne launch, to lend it the
authority of the sceptic.
</p><!--l. 30804--><p class="indent" >  “This is a true conjuction,” Preeta decides. “That sounds pretty New Age, doesn&#x2019;t
it? Instead of a conjunction of the planets and stars, this is a conjunction of
information ﬂows and people.”

</p><!--l. 30808--><p class="indent" >  “Which we have engineered together to create a unique situation,” Jonathan
crowns.
</p><!--l. 30810--><p class="indent" >  “A situation that allows a change to occur,” Bishop enhances.
</p><!--l. 30812--><p class="indent" >  “I belive it&#x2019;s called punctuated equilibrium,” Jonas informs them.
</p><!--l. 30814--><p class="indent" >  “And evolution shall be averted for lack of a catastrophe for now.”
</p><!--l. 30816--><p class="indent" >  “All right,” Jonathan calls, “Snow machines at the ready.”
</p><!--l. 30818--><p class="indent" >  And, as they deploy their infectious mist, rolling it in from the great ocean of
communication, it forms a wave of inﬂuence that seeps almost invisibly through the
onion layers of the game. Changes begin to be seeded; perturbations destabilize the
hybrid potentials. Even in the primordial mixture of characters and notions they have
concocted, there is a new possibility threatening to emerge. It aspires to be the
blueprint for that most elusive of creatures: success.
</p><!--l. 30826--><p class="indent" >  So now the real game is on.

</p><!--l. 30834--><p class="indent" >  The Senator&#x2019;s limo careers rapidly through the Washington districts, pursued by a
posse of paparazzi journalists.
</p><!--l. 30837--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">They are like a pack of rats</span>, he thinks, <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">or enraged chimpanzees seeking their pound</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">of human ﬂesh.</span>
</p><!--l. 30840--><p class="indent" >  “We could lose this opportunity entirely at this stage,” the aid tells him.
</p><!--l. 30843--><p class="indent" >  The senator views focuses on his aid, tearing his mind away from other
things.
</p><!--l. 30845--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, it&#x2019;s almost as though someone knew exactly our strategy.” His matter-of-factness
belies his true anger at what is happening.
</p><!--l. 30848--><p class="indent" >  Dean adjusts his heart monitor, moving it aside, and pours himself a brandy as
calmly as he can. The precariousness of his condition has not yet impacted on his
equanimity. They can shoot you, but they can&#x2019;t make you beg.
</p><!--l. 30853--><p class="indent" >  This whole recent business ﬁlls him with a deep sense of suspicion and betrayal. It
is almost as though there has been some kind of conspiracy to turn the tables against
them. Only a few weeks ago it seemed as though their plan was invincible, and people
were ready for it. They believed in the church&#x2019;s authority and its rightful place at the
head of the country. Now what is going on? Stories about the legitimacy of the
operation are leaking like Iraqi oil, every bit as explosive and poisonous. Journalists
are behaving like a pack of hungry wolves, desperate to ﬁnd some ﬂaw in their
authority.
</p><!--l. 30863--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Did we oﬀend the press somehow? How did they ﬁnd out about this?</span>
</p><!--l. 30865--><p class="indent" >  Their competitors in government are rubbing their hands together in anticipation of
imminent failure. The mobile voters were supposed to force the issue for them, but the
game campaign has neither fully materialized nor been the overwhelming success that
was promised. How much money did government spend on building this wretched
white elephant?
</p><!--l. 30872--><p class="indent" >  And their little coup was to come as a surprise, and yet obviously they have known
about the plan for some time. You cannot hide things from the secret service or the

Three Letter Agencies.
</p><!--l. 30876--><p class="indent" >  What makes it worse? Despite the best eﬀorts of his team, god-damned Senator
Weisskopf is actually getting ahead in the polls again, trying to push for some
hell-blazing school rehabilitation program. How could it be that he is actually popular
in the southern states, for crying out loud? And with education? Some idiot has
miscalculated badly and will pay for their mistake.
</p><!--l. 30883--><p class="indent" >  “Can&#x2019;t you lose these goddamned sharks?” the Senator barks into his intercom.
</p><!--l. 30886--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m trying, sir,” the tinny voice of the driver replies. “We have decoys on the
way.”
</p><!--l. 30889--><p class="indent" >  “Now even the FBI are breathing down our necks,” his aid murmurs, in a state of
awe.
</p><!--l. 30892--><p class="indent" >  “Relax, they have no mandate to come in here. We are not doing anything that
would be construed as criminal. We are the ones trying to help the American people
back to a righteousness. We are free to broadcast our ideas to whomever we
wish.”
</p><!--l. 30897--><p class="indent" >  “There are no borders other than the ones we make for ourselves.”
</p><!--l. 30899--><p class="indent" >  “Amen to that.”
</p><!--l. 30901--><p class="indent" >  He takes a slug of brandy, as if ‘Amen&#x2019; were to mean ‘cheers&#x2019; and yells another
‘come on&#x2019; at the driver.
</p><!--l. 30904--><p class="indent" >  “We have not given up our strategy yet, but things are right on the edge. Our
game parameters are based on one set of assumptions. I&#x2019;m not sure that they
are still valid now.” His aid mumbles, almost to himself, apparently in more
distress than the senator himself, and almost as if he believes that the senator is
not really listening to him—which is probably true. Denial is a powerful
medicine.
</p><!--l. 30911--><p class="indent" >  “The educational campaign is making us look stupid,” Dean grates. “We have been
practically reduced to a comic chapter on the anthropology of ceremonial cultures.
Long robes and gold and sequins. They practically turn the Reverend into a side-show
Carney.”
</p><!--l. 30917--><p class="indent" >  “The church leaders have been expressing their worry.”
</p><!--l. 30919--><p class="indent" >  “We can&#x2019;t aﬀord to spend any more on this. There are other matters to attend to as
well.”
</p><!--l. 30922--><p class="indent" >  “Spending is only slightly over budget.”
</p><!--l. 30924--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m talking about the riots, man,” he growls. “What use is a shepherd if he doesn&#x2019;t
even have a ﬂock?”
</p><!--l. 30927--><p class="indent" >  His aid continues: “FEMA are addressing the problems of riots, but they are not
getting anywhere fast. Some of them are turning nasty—anti-government, and
anti-church demonstrations too in the state of California. But the state governments
have no resources to implement the action plans. They&#x2019;re not going to stop anytime
soon”
</p><!--l. 30934--><p class="indent" >  Dean barks a scoﬃng laugh. “The Federal Emergency Management Agency?” He
pronounces with mock reverence. “Hah! What kind of joke are they. In a situation
like this, they are the masters of an empire of dirt. What are they going to

coordinate into action, eh? Fifty years of the American people looking at
government as their enemy, and we have an emaciated infrastructure. The country
is collapsing from lack of maintenance, and all because Americans won&#x2019;t
pay taxes. If we were running the show, things would be diﬀerent. You can
say one thing about the church and that is they know how to manage their
ﬁnances.”
</p><!--l. 30945--><p class="indent" >  The car lifts them high into the air, leaving their stomachs behind, as his aid
receives an incoming call. A glaze descends over him, or is it perhaps a nausea? If a
condemned man can lose heart, his own has apparently skipped a beat. He looks
squarely at his master.
</p><!--l. 30950--><p class="indent" >  “That was Jennifer. The Canadians have promised that they will withdraw their
support for the military actions in the Middle East and Africa if the vote goes ahead.
The Canadian foreign minister said. . .”
</p><!--l. 30954--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, yes, I get the picture. How in the blazes have they caught wind of this
now?”
</p><!--l. 30957--><p class="indent" >  “That means that there will be signiﬁcant pressure on the senate.”
</p><!--l. 30959--><p class="indent" >  “Another leak.”
</p><!--l. 30961--><p class="indent" >  “It would seem to be the case.”
</p><!--l. 30963--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah, diddly.” Dean is apparently succumbing to the inﬂuence. He seems like a
huﬀy child now.
</p><!--l. 30966--><p class="indent" >  The car careers around another bend, evoking another curse from his lips. The aid
begins typing away at his tablet, looking grim, nervous and pale.
</p><!--l. 30970--><p class="indent" >  “You know, my kid has a brother in the VR. Beth and I didn&#x2019;t want any more kids,
so we got one of these sims that are designed for third world families. You
know, the kind that&#x2019;s meant to stop them from wanting too many mouths to
feed.”
</p><!--l. 30975--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, sir. I know the kind.”
</p><!--l. 30977--><p class="indent" >  “They are actually not a bad little invention. Nice piece of American engineering.”
</p><!--l. 30980--><p class="indent" >  The aid lacks the heart to tell him that the invention is Japanese, perhaps because
his cardiac account is already struggling with arrears. The car swerves around a bend
and hits a bump which sends them ﬂying into the air. The senator&#x2019;s brandy spills on
his leg.
</p><!--l. 30986--><p class="indent" >  “Damned game.”
</p><!--l. 30988--><p class="indent" >  “Yessir.”
</p><!--l. 30990--><p class="indent" >  “What about this Morris? Isn&#x2019;t he supposed to be working for us?”
</p><!--l. 30992--><p class="indent" >  “Do we really know if he is any good?”
</p><!--l. 30994--><p class="indent" >  “If he isn&#x2019;t we can sue him for all he&#x2019;s got.”
</p><!--l. 30996--><p class="indent" >  “But then it will be too late.”
</p><!--l. 30998--><p class="indent" >  “Our message will be heard eventually. The Lord will guide us.” He reaches for the
bottle of brandy, but another swerve makes him miss. “If necessary, we can remind the
House of Representatives of their obligations. Michael has dirt on most of
them.”
</p><!--l. 31004--><p class="indent" >  “You mean blackmail?”

</p><!--l. 31006--><p class="indent" >  “Why not”
</p><!--l. 31008--><p class="indent" >  “But can we get away with it?” The aid&#x2019;s spineless voice is shrill now.
</p><!--l. 31010--><p class="indent" >  Dean sits back in his seat without moving. The car seems to have stabilized and is
driving smoothly on a freeway. There is a silence to chill the warmth of the car&#x2019;s
interior. It seems to beckon to the ghosts of past failures and invite the circling of
vultures.
</p><!--l. 31015--><p class="indent" >  “We&#x2019;ll do as we please,” he pronounces sternly, looking out of the window at
something indeterminate. “It was people like us who built America. The law was
made to protect us, not defeat us.”
</p><!--l. 31019--><p class="indent" >  “And the FBI?”
</p><!--l. 31021--><p class="indent" >  “Our hearts are pure.”
</p><!--l. 31023--><p class="indent" >  “They do not know anything speciﬁc yet.”
</p><!--l. 31025--><p class="indent" >  “Do you think they really despise us?” he says, absently. “China and Russia are
doing their damndest now to squeeze us out of central Asia. If we don&#x2019;t move quickly,
we could be set back years. Canada has been asking us to go easy on the French and
the Africans.”
</p><!--l. 31030--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">What is he talking about now? </span>His voice has begun to take on a slight slur. Is it the
brandy, or perhaps another minor stroke?
</p><!--l. 31033--><p class="indent" >  “Sir, are you all right? Do you need your medication?”
</p><!--l. 31035--><p class="indent" >  “Idiot!”
</p><!--l. 31037--><p class="indent" >  Dean stirs from his statue-like pose and leans forward. He seems to be staring into
space.

<!--l. 31048--><p class="indent" >  “So,” Ivar babbles, to ﬁll a predicted void. “What are you going to do when this is
all over?” He jabs his apple onto the end of a knife and thrusts it in front of Preeta&#x2019;s
mouth.
</p><!--l. 31052--><p class="indent" >  “Over?” she laughs. “What makes you think this is going to end?”
</p><!--l. 31054--><p class="indent" >  “It is not the journalist&#x2019;s perogative to suppose,” he plays.
</p><!--l. 31056--><p class="indent" >  “Don&#x2019;t believe in that concept.” She raises a palm. “Sorry. This is like the pot of
gold at the end of the rainbow. It&#x2019;s only there because they know you can never reach
it.”
</p><!--l. 31061--><p class="indent" >  “It is not over,” Bishop murmurs. “What have we really done? There is no stability.
We haven&#x2019;t stopped anything. Perhaps we have delayed something. But this isn&#x2019;t
going to help society ﬁnd a direction to latch onto. We&#x2019;re still a visionless economic
merry-go-round.” He refocuses on the little group. “The important thing was to
assemble a strong counterforce. That is the role of police, after all. I think our little
group is onto something here. The FBI has set up some tests. They are going to be
looking carefully at what we&#x2019;ve done. We should try to solve them well. It will give us

credibility and practice.”
</p><!--l. 31072--><p class="indent" >  “You don&#x2019;t think we are ready to handle ourselves now?”
</p><!--l. 31074--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s not the point.”
</p><!--l. 31076--><p class="indent" >  “Well,” Preeta says. “We might have been ‘assembled&#x2019;, and we might be a success
so far. What really interests me is who has been coordinating all of this? Who is
behind it all? And don&#x2019;t tell me it is all coincidence that all of us are here together
with the right tools for the job.”
</p><!--l. 31082--><p class="indent" >  Bishop stares at her for a long instant, with a new respect and a kindly smile. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Good</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">girl, </span>he thinks. “Does it really matter?”
</p><!--l. 31086--><p class="indent" >  “Shouldn&#x2019;t we be allowed to know?”
</p><!--l. 31088--><p class="indent" >  Bishop purses his lips and avoids the remark. “None of this will make any
diﬀerence in the long run unless something happens to back it up.”
</p><!--l. 31091--><p class="indent" >  Jonathan, ever at his heels, adds: “We&#x2019;ve had our little forest ﬁre, cleared some
space so we can see the wood for the trees. But the forest lives and it will
try to close in again. We have to hope that the signals we&#x2019;ve sown are good
ones.”
</p><!--l. 31096--><p class="indent" >  “In the end, it&#x2019;s not what we do that matters. It&#x2019;s what ordinary people think, and
how they react. The law doesn&#x2019;t exist without the basic agreement of common folk.
They are the material we are trying to bend into shape.”
</p><!--l. 31102--><p class="indent" >  “One thing though,” Ivar laughs, in that geeky boyish way that he cannot control.
“You have to admit, it&#x2019;s pretty cool to know that our main weapon against the
corruption of Christianity was Christmas.”

<!--l. 31113--><p class="indent" >  In the game, Vibe&#x2019;s appearance is that of a stunning young woman, with a mere
sheen of metallic spray to clothe her female form. Her skin-tight attire covers more
her psyche than her avatar&#x2019;s body. Dermot ﬁnds himself staring and Preeta is equally
entranced at her audacity.
</p><!--l. 31119--><p class="indent" >  She has with her a friend whom she calls Bea, who is equal in height but with a
subtly diﬀerent, similarly audacious ﬁgure. They have been playing along with the
agents. Things are working out, thanks to Dermot&#x2019;s handiwork.
</p><!--l. 31123--><p class="indent" >  “This game is pretty cool.”
</p><!--l. 31125--><p class="indent" >  “Think it&#x2019;s worth a BAFTA?” Dermot asks.
</p><!--l. 31127--><p class="indent" >  “The morality barometer is pretty cheesy.”
</p><!--l. 31129--><p class="indent" >  “It was supposed to be.”
</p><!--l. 31131--><p class="indent" >  Mary Cheung is waiting for the girls when they arrive.
</p><!--l. 31133--><p class="indent" >  “So, are you with us?” Vibe asks.
</p><!--l. 31135--><p class="indent" >  “Yes. Can I tag along?”

</p><!--l. 31137--><p class="indent" >  “Reckon that would be all right.”
</p><!--l. 31139--><p class="indent" >  “You should meet my brother,” Mary says. “He is going to be so excited.”
</p><!--l. 31141--><p class="indent" >  And that means, he will do what she tells him.
</p><!--l. 31143--><p class="indent" >  So, the ghosts and denizens of the game have become adept at manipulating their
creators, Dermot thinks. It is not really a big surprise though, is it? After all, the game
rules are designed with just that in mind. They built the ultimate propaganda
machine: naturally it would work on them too. But unlike a gun, a weapon of
destruction, it does not kill: rather it becomes part <span

</p><!--l. 31165--><p class="indent" >  No one on the speaker.

the building. What on Earth could that be about?
</p><!--l. 31170--><p class="indent" >  She opens the door and stares at the intrusion.
</p><!--l. 31172--><p class="indent" >  It is him!
</p><!--l. 31174--><p class="indent" >  Frank is here.
</p><!--l. 31176--><p class="indent" >  He is carrying her backpack over one shoulder.
</p><!--l. 31178--><p class="indent" >  “Hi, Sara.”

always get her way, but there are certain limits beyond which one expects to
succeed.
</p><!--l. 31184--><p class="indent" >  “Oh my god, hello!” she stammers, struggling to quell a visceral tempest of
questions and emotions.
</p><!--l. 31187--><p class="indent" >  Frank grins in amusement at her petriﬁcation.
</p><!--l. 31189--><p class="indent" >  “Can I come in? This is pretty heavy.”
</p><!--l. 31191--><p class="indent" >  She looks at the backpack and remembers her manners. “Eh, yes! Yes! Sorry, come
in!”
</p><!--l. 31194--><p class="indent" >  He steps through the doorway and she closes it behind him, peering curiously
around the hallway to make sure that no other lurkers are hiding in the shadows. How
did he get in?
</p><!--l. 31198--><p class="indent" >  “How did you get in?” she asks, ﬁnally.
</p><!--l. 31200--><p class="indent" >  “There are certain advantages to being an oﬃcer of the law,” he winks. Frank
releases the backpack from his shoulder onto a pile of her shoes. “Oops, sorry. I
thought you might like to have this back.”
</p><!--l. 31204--><p class="indent" >  “Are you kidding?”

</p><!--l. 31206--><p class="indent" >  “Nope. All checked and accounted for.”
</p><!--l. 31208--><p class="indent" >  “Thank you! I mean, I didn&#x2019;t expect you to bring it. . .”
</p><!--l. 31210--><p class="indent" >  He grins back at her. “Actually, as it turns out, I was coming to Oslo anyway. I have
a course at police college for a few of days, so I thought I&#x2019;d see if you were home. You
left in kind of a hurry and I wasn&#x2019;t sure if I had maybe done something to oﬀend
you.”
</p><!--l. 31215--><p class="indent" >  She shakes her head in surprise, momentarily at a loss for words, and deﬁnitely not
the coolest cookie she has ever baked. “Like what?”
</p><!--l. 31219--><p class="indent" >  He shrugs. “I thought we were getting to be friends, so I was disappointed when
you were suddenly gone.”
</p><!--l. 31222--><p class="indent" >  “I didn&#x2019;t really have time,” she begins. “I got this call, about a job.”
</p><!--l. 31225--><p class="indent" >  “A job? I thought you were studying?”
</p><!--l. 31227--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, it&#x2019;s kind of a long story.”
</p><!--l. 31229--><p class="indent" >  “All right.”
</p><!--l. 31231--><p class="indent" >  “But I had to leave in a hurry. It was nothing personal. I did send you a message. .
.eventually. It took a little while to ﬁnd you.”
</p><!--l. 31234--><p class="indent" >  “Good.”
</p><!--l. 31236--><p class="indent" >  “So. . .so. . .you&#x2019;re here!”
</p><!--l. 31238--><p class="indent" >  “Yes,” he conﬁrms. “Service with a smile.”
</p><!--l. 31240--><p class="indent" >  “I. . . Oh my god. Ehh, so, look, have a seat. Sorry about the mess. I wasn&#x2019;t

nervously.
</p><!--l. 31243--><p class="indent" >  He takes oﬀ his jacket and walks the few steps through a doorway to sit himself
down on the sofa. It is a small apartment, but cozy.
</p><!--l. 31246--><p class="indent" >  “Nice apartment,” he says.
</p><!--l. 31248--><p class="indent" >  “Thanks. So, eh, would you like some coﬀee or tea or something?”
</p><!--l. 31250--><p class="indent" >  “Actually, I can&#x2019;t stay long, but maybe later?”
</p><!--l. 31252--><p class="indent" >  Later? “Oh, okay.” She examines his face. He looks less vulnerable here: harder,
more conﬁdent, at home. She is not sure what she feels. “So are you going to be
staying for long?”
</p><!--l. 31256--><p class="indent" >  “A few days.”
</p><!--l. 31258--><p class="indent" >  “You already said that. Stupid me.” She was not prepared for this. It&#x2019;s not fair! “So
where will you be staying?”
</p><!--l. 31262--><p class="indent" >  “There&#x2019;s a hotel close to the college. Majorstuen.”
</p><!--l. 31264--><p class="indent" >  She nods.
</p><!--l. 31266--><p class="indent" >  “So tell me, “ he asks. “What did you do to upset my colleague? How did this end
up getting conﬁscated?”
</p><!--l. 31269--><p class="indent" >  She shrugs. “It&#x2019;s a long story. It doesn&#x2019;t matter.”
</p><!--l. 31271--><p class="indent" >  “Good to have it back though?”
</p><!--l. 31273--><p class="indent" >  “My stuﬀ is in here,” she aﬃrms.
</p><!--l. 31276--><p class="indent" >  “Maybe you should check everything is okay.”
</p><!--l. 31278--><p class="indent" >  She nods. “Good idea.”

</p><!--l. 31280--><p class="indent" >  Vibe drags the sack into the living room and clips it open. She peers into what was
her home for the better part of a week. The pack is quite full: soft items on the top,
heavier ones below. She begins to empty the contents onto the ﬂoor around her,
making an impromptu campsite.
</p><!--l. 31286--><p class="indent" >  “Making a mess,” she smiles, feeling a little as though she is undressing in front of
him.
</p><!--l. 31289--><p class="indent" >  He seems to sense her discomfort. “Can I use your bathroom?” he asks.
</p><!--l. 31291--><p class="indent" >  She nods. “By the door.”
</p><!--l. 31293--><p class="indent" >  The contents of the rucksack appear to be intact. It doesn&#x2019;t even seem as though
anyone has looked through them. Pussy beat bitch was obviously just messing with
her. Her tablet is there. It still contains some of the work she did before she left. It
hasn&#x2019;t been synchronized with home yet.
</p><!--l. 31299--><p class="indent" >  Seeing this backpack again brings a feeling of strangeness to be home again.
So much has changed. So many new things in her life. For a split second,
she misses her family: her brother, her mother. Then she feels silly at the
response.
</p><!--l. 31304--><p class="indent" >  She has crossed a boundary within herself these past weeks, an unexpected frontier
of realization. Perhaps that is what it means to grow up, or perhaps it is the ﬁrst of
many changes in her life. It doesn&#x2019;t really matter, does it? She has seen through the
deceptions that life attempts to pile on. There will be no more romantic fantasies
in her life from now on. There is a sense of ending, as well as a sense of
beginning.
</p><!--l. 31312--><p class="indent" >  In the bottom of the backpack is a hard item that brings a new dread. She
looks at the box from Mrs. Laurent. There it is. Her nemesis, in monolithic
form. She could open it now. But does she need to? Does she want to know
what is in it? Perhaps some things are better left unknown? She places it
on a small table, where she can look at it, and ponders its form. What will
she release if she opens it? How will it change her new life? A life that it
working out well, which she is enjoying. Could she have both lives? Is that
greedy?
</p><!--l. 31322--><p class="indent" >  Frank stands in the doorway. “Okay?” he says.
</p><!--l. 31324--><p class="indent" >  She looks at him. “Okay,” she replies with a trace of melancholy, and her throat
contracts so that she has to swallow to relieve the ache of guilt.
</p><!--l. 31328--><p class="indent" >  Frank looked after her when she was sick. How many people have done that for
her? Now he has come all the way here with her backpack, on the slightest of hints.
And he is nice, in an odd sort of way: not really the kind of person she expected to
like, but the fact is there. And he clearly likes her.
</p><!--l. 31334--><p class="indent" >  “You know”, he says, “it&#x2019;s not that far to Majorstuen. Maybe we can meet up while
I&#x2019;m here?”
</p><!--l. 31337--><p class="indent" >  She smiles. It is only about a kilometre. “But you&#x2019;re not staying long.” The words
seem strange in her mouth as though she is not quite sure how to phrase them
suddenly. Why did she even say that? What does it matter how long he is here
for?

</p><!--l. 31342--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">He didn&#x2019;t ask to marry you, stupid.</span>
</p><!--l. 31344--><p class="indent" >  “Well. It&#x2019;s not that far to Oslo either, and I&#x2019;m getting transferred soon.”
</p><!--l. 31346--><p class="indent" >  “Where to?”
</p><!--l. 31348--><p class="indent" >  “Guess.”
</p><!--l. 31350--><p class="indent" >  She smiles optimistically and then it fades. He looks down at his feet.
</p><!--l. 31353--><p class="indent" >  “Okay then,” he nods and moves to exit.
</p><!--l. 31355--><p class="indent" >  Vibe feels disappointment envelop and ﬂood through her, in an instant. She has not
really understood, before now, exactly what she feels about him. Their journey
together has been serendipitous rather than planned, and all the time she has been
distracted by a diﬀerent, stupid romantic fantasy.
</p><!--l. 31361--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">It is possible to enjoy something that you haven&#x2019;t chosen yourself.</span>
</p><!--l. 31363--><p class="indent" >  Frank seems to reconsider and stops himself. “Give me a hug?” he asks, almost
apologetically.
</p><!--l. 31366--><p class="indent" >  Vibe explodes into a toothy grin and leaps up from the backpack, embracing him
needily. More than he expected, he reciprocates hesitantly.
</p><!--l. 31369--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Damn it</span>, she thinks, <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I have to take charge here</span>.
</p><!--l. 31371--><p class="indent" >  She pushes back from him and kisses him ﬁrmly on the lips for several seconds
before looking him in the eyes and grinning.
</p><!--l. 31374--><p class="indent" >  “Wow!” he laughs back in amazement. Then again: “Wow!”
</p><!--l. 31376--><p class="indent" >  They laugh and hug again and steal another kiss.
</p><!--l. 31378--><p class="indent" >  “See you soon then,” she says.
</p><!--l. 31380--><p class="indent" >  “See you soon, Sara.”
</p><!--l. 31382--><p class="indent" >  They part slowly with a glancing farewell, grinning like two stupid adult
kids.
</p><!--l. 31384--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Boys! </span>She smiles. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">So stupid, so necessary.</span>
</p><!--l. 31386--><p class="indent" >  Sara Vibeke Stensrud looks up to the ceiling to take in the moment. She feels
somehow lighter than before, and jumps up and down twice to test the notion. The
future is there in front of her. She knows a way forward. Perhaps it is only one of
many paths, or perhaps it is the right one. She doesn&#x2019;t really care. It feels good and
that, after all, is a good enough reason to follow it. Everything is going to be okay, she
thinks.
</p><!--l. 31394--><p class="indent" >  Then, almost as an afterthought she remembers herself and smiles. Bea has got to
hear this.
</p><!--l. 31397--><p class="indent" >  So then, out with the mobile.
</p><!--l. 31406--><p class="indent" >  <mbp:pagebreak/>

</p><!--l. 31406--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmb7t-x-x-172">Epilogue</span>
</p><!--l. 31411--><p class="indent" >  It is May, soon to be summer, and all the trees are exploding with green and white
blossoms. The heavy pollen-leaden odour of the bushes makes the air thick and hard
to breathe.
</p><!--l. 31415--><p class="indent" >  Jonas is out walking.
</p><!--l. 31417--><p class="indent" >  For a few moments, he has time to be alone with his thoughts, thoughts that tumble
amidst a garden of possibility, which borders on a landﬁll of corruption. He has
brought a book with him—a novel, no less. He took it in virtual deﬁance of his
pursuers. When was is it last he was able to read for mere pleasure? How long has he
been shackled by responsibility, his pleasure centres immobilised by fatigue? All that
could be about to change.
</p><!--l. 31425--><p class="indent" >  He settles onto a wooden bench in the glade of the park, in a spot where he can
enjoy the still water of a nearby pond. These moments of rest will do him good before
they ﬁnd him. A few words of something other than project descriptions, or rules and
regulations: it helps to quench the impatience.
</p><!--l. 31431--><p class="indent" >  The park is relatively quiet here, at this late hour of the day. Most people are
already on their way home from work, but there are some here. A woman strolls past
him with her child and he pauses to admire their harmony. One has to envy the look of
placid contentment, the calm rapport she seems to have with the youngster,
as if some inner telepathy soothes their companionship with complete and
mutual understanding. It is not exactly the way he frames his own image of
fatherhood, with Kaja. Others seem to make relationships work, why couldn&#x2019;t
he?
</p><!--l. 31441--><p class="indent" >  Perhaps there is a dozen reasons, perhaps there is only himself to blame. The time
for judgement has, at any rate, passed. Now the challenge has become a diﬀerent one:
one of continuation, of redressing past mistakes and moving on with future
possibilities. He has been compiling a list of things he owes Martin, and now
that there is more distance between them, he is even interacting better with
Kaja.

</p><!--l. 31449--><p class="indent" >  Jonas can imagine now how a glacier feels, thawing from its own private ice age: all
that independent water, once in free ﬂight, dragged down into a pool of anonymity,
locked into bondage by the grip of an oppressive winter, ﬁnally feeling its spirit
released by a kinder, warmer sun. It signals the beginning of a new cycle. To happen
all over again?
</p><!--l. 31456--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Perish the thought.</span>
</p><!--l. 31458--><p class="indent" >  The woman continues on with her child, smiling at that sun, without a visible worry
in the world. He envies her. He actually envies her.
</p><!--l. 31463--><p class="indent" >  In her footsteps, something stranger still: a large bearded man, dressed in black
jeans and rock-group nano-shirt, ambles comically into view. Jonas turn his head
slightly to see the man stoop and pick up the ice-cream paper which her child
has dropped. He places it, with visible annoyance, into a litter bin near the
bench.
</p><!--l. 31469--><p class="indent" >  Observe this overt display of civic responsibility! It is cause enough to be taken
aback. The man is not a park employee. He is an ordinary man, with no apparent
connection to her. On the other hand, he is about the right age, about the right proﬁle.
Could this be the result of Edward Bishop&#x2019;s work? Has this man been inﬂuenced in
his thinking, in his attitudes by a succubus?
</p><!--l. 31476--><p class="indent" >  It is surely too early to tell who is responsible: whether the eﬀect of their
campaigning is measurable, or whether he is just an anomalous occurrence, a
fortuitous anachronism of the modern world. However you look at it, this is a wonder
to behold.
</p><!--l. 31481--><p class="indent" >  His mobile vibrates suddenly, with a simple message from Sara.
</p><!--l. 31483--><p class="indent" >  She replies simply: “The vice president was an algorithm?” He smiles at the
response, uncertain whether she is joking or not.
</p><!--l. 31486--><p class="indent" >  Jonas posted a quote from a former Vice-President Al Gore: something about ”the
greatest discovery of all this research is that we can no longer can separate basic from
applied science The disciplines are connected in ways they have never been before. . .”
It seemed like an appropriate encouragement of her current work at the time:
something to keep her on the hook of expectation. The machinations of bureaucracy
are not over yet as far as her PhD is concerned, but Sara is a survivor. She will do all
right, no matter what happens next.
</p><!--l. 31495--><p class="indent" >  Jonas tries to open his book. He has a lot on his mind that wants to say its piece.
Reading seems out of the question. Another good plan extinguished.
</p><!--l. 31499--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Soon, soon.</span>
</p><!--l. 31501--><p class="indent" >  This apparently bottomless process of defending the institutions of research and
education has been long and arduous. It has taken him through trials and ordeals of
stamina that would break many. Another man might have crumbled before him, but
he has been partially anaesthetised by his own personal conﬂict. Jonas has
weathered the adversity with a brave face; but he also also senses that he has
approached breaking point several times along the way, as a donkey&#x2019;s back
is broken under the incremental addition of an inﬁnity of falling pieces of
straw.

</p><!--l. 31511--><p class="indent" >  But why should he care about any of that today? Today, he could be the survivor
himself. This could be it: the end of this little battle for his integrity. Now that the sun
is shining, he no longer cares as much for the problems of oﬃce. He is purged by a
pregnant sun and his own endocrine reaction. The burgeoning warmth of the day
surrenders his worries to the realms of the academic, pun or no pun. And now also: a
relative calm has fallen over his personal life, leaving him to feel unconcerned
about the outcome of the ﬁnal challenge: the one ﬁnal obfuscation that will
permit substance to triumph over style. Politics will surely have to accept
reason.
</p><!--l. 31522--><p class="indent" >  But it is a delicate business, and not quite done yet. No wonder inﬂuence campaigns
have to be planned so carefully: if the sun alone can cleanse an individual&#x2019;s purpose
and passion, what hope does one have of ruling anyone&#x2019;s attention? Each little
environmental signal is simply part of a grand regatta of impulses, sailing
into the ﬁnish line, competing for the attention—for the prize of the human
brain.
</p><!--l. 31530--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">And if there were a god, he would have to be pretty disappointed that such a</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">powerful and expensive instrument could be played so easily, by so trivial a</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">troubadour.</span>
</p><!--l. 31535--><p class="indent" >  It will not be long now. He had better put his book away and start walking. He will
head towards the canopy of the trees to ﬁnd some shade.
</p><!--l. 31539--><p class="indent" >  Jonas gets up from the bench and stands tall. More than ever, at this moment, he
feels as though he is alone, but surviving. It gives him a taste almost of power, of
self-conﬁdence. It evokes an eerily surreal sensation. He feels taller, when he walks:
he feels every step. It is dizzying. He feels larger than life somehow, hypersensitive.
Motion is accentuated.
</p><!--l. 31546--><p class="indent" >  It is supremacy.
</p><!--l. 31548--><p class="indent" >  Mastery over oneself.
</p><!--l. 31550--><p class="indent" >  He takes no particular pleasure in the feeling. That might come later. For now, it
simply is. He acknowledges it rationally and ﬁles the observation for possible use, like
the orderly clerk that he is.
</p><!--l. 31555--><p class="indent" >  And then he comes to the little wooden bridge that bisects the pond.
</p><!--l. 31558--><p class="indent" >  He knows that they will have been alerted to his work by now, at the ministry. The
ﬁnal stage has to include them, as the EU commission challenges them to conﬁrm
their surrender of research funds against the basic guidelines of the community. And
therein lay an unexpected pitfall for the government.
</p><!--l. 31564--><p class="indent" >  There is, of course, a diﬀerence between making the decisions and actually
wielding the axe. Both turn out to be double edged swords, so to speak. If a
bureaucracy can hinder the implementation of the research council&#x2019;s independent
decisions, then the council has an equal power to obstruct their intervention with
bureaucracy. The mindless leviathan does not take sides, it merely lumbers with the
obstinacy of habit. A commander of government can easily run aground on the perils
of its own bureaucracy, for commanders generally trust their soldiers, under
threat of execution, incarceration or even ex-communication. What will be his

punishment?
</p><!--l. 31575--><p class="indent" >  He has seen through their game. The tune they dance to is one of short term gains:
fast rewards and sound-bite press releases, neither methodical nor considered
decisions. So, he has been learning the tricks of the trade and has moved his pieces
carefully on the board to manoeuvre his opponent into a check mate. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Shah mat! </span>Die
king..
</p><!--l. 31581--><p class="indent" >  It has ground him down, and worn him out, but he is still standing. So, at this
moment, he has earned the right to be in the park, observing the young and the
beautiful, without risking the guilt or repercussions that have haunted him over the
past year. And, my goodness, the spring hatches these beautiful visions of
womanhood from their cocoons in numbers. It does not matter that they are merely
distant fantasies. To him, they represent hope.
</p><!--l. 31590--><p class="indent" >  For a moment he believes he sees Edward Bishop, but no, it is someone else. He has
gotten to know the older man a little over the past months. He is looking older these
days, but with a contentment about his work. Bishop claims that they have put
a temporary cork into organized crime: maﬁa, vigilante groups, churches.
Those organizations are opportunistic scavengers, who operate best when
society is broken and fearful. If the game&#x2019;s many signals were to heal and unite
people, if it were to be a unifying force for good, strengthening and educating
people rather than driving them apart, it would signal an end to their power.
He is their worst enemy. Someone built a crooked house, and his team is
straightening it out. The world of tomorrow will live in the House that Bishop
built.
</p><!--l. 31605--><p class="indent" >  That the churches have not visibly succeeded in usurping the power from western
states tells them that someone, somewhere must be playing their games: games that
his team has spiked with altruism. It would make an interesting research project
to follow who is doing what to make it all work, but they have to simply
take it on trust for now. That&#x2019;s ﬁne. Somewhere in the world, pretty much
anything you can think of is happening somewhere. That&#x2019;s what diversity
does for you. As long as the melody resonates, it will ﬁnd its place in the
symphony.
</p><!--l. 31615--><p class="indent" >  Bishop&#x2019;s team is a bright constellation and they have helped him in unimaginable
and intangible ways. Without them he might not have understood how to avoid the
ﬁnal move in his own game of chess. It was the Indian girl, Sara&#x2019;s new friend
who told him: “Why is it that you didn&#x2019;t think of simply asking anyone for
help?”
</p><!--l. 31621--><p class="indent" >  It was an excellent question.
</p><!--l. 31623--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Have we become so independent, so disconnected that we cannot even ask our</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">friends and neighbours to help us out in a time of trouble?</span>
</p><!--l. 31627--><p class="indent" >  People don&#x2019;t ask each other for help anymore. His mobile doesn&#x2019;t have a menu
option for that. It took an alien to diagnose the malady.
</p><!--l. 31632--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">What is wrong with us that we cannot even recognize and come together when we</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">have common goals?</span>

</p><!--l. 31635--><p class="indent" >  They have become Africa, as Joe said. Life is mercenary in a selﬁsh world.
</p><!--l. 31638--><p class="indent" >  So he asked for help.
</p><!--l. 31640--><p class="indent" >  And Bishop&#x2019;s bright constellation was happy to assist. He shrugged at the
suggestion that he was being generous. “My voice has been heard,” he conﬁded. “I&#x2019;ve
done my little recruiting campaign and we&#x2019;ve put together a plausible new force. My
little mission has been fulﬁlled. Where does it takes us? Just to the next phase. Maybe
yours in the next phase.”
</p><!--l. 31647--><p class="indent" >  “What you&#x2019;ve done will last, as long as there are people with skills to carry on the
team,” Jonas assured him. “With people like Sara at the wheel, a little bureaucracy
won&#x2019;t be enough to stop it.”
</p><!--l. 31651--><p class="indent" >  They might never know what was really going to happen. But that is not really the
point is it? The point is that it is happening all the time. It never stops. And they are
just participants and spectators. It&#x2019;s all one big fairground ride, where big splashes are
really just little ripples. The game will continue with or without the VR. It has been
running since the start of time. Right now, it involves the future of education and of
society.
</p><!--l. 31660--><p class="indent" >  Jonas approaches the fountain pool and takes a last peek at his book and his
moment arrives.
</p><!--l. 31663--><p class="indent" >  “Mr. Lindgren!”
</p><!--l. 31665--><p class="indent" >  It is the detestable Leif Erik Larsen, accompanied by two police oﬃcers. Bishop
has provided them, and is watching their progress from somewhere. They will do
their jobs, but their will not step over the line of the law for this petty power
seeker.
</p><!--l. 31670--><p class="indent" >  “Good day, Mr. Larsen.”
</p><!--l. 31672--><p class="indent" >  “I had a little trouble ﬁnding you. I believe you know why I am here.”
</p><!--l. 31674--><p class="indent" >  He nods, carefully placing his paperback novel inside a small plastic carrier bag,
and putting it into a deep pocket of his jacket to protect it.
</p><!--l. 31677--><p class="indent" >  “You want me to cancel the appeal application to the European Union&#x2019;s arbitration
board.”
</p><!--l. 31680--><p class="indent" >  “That would be the polite thing to do.”
</p><!--l. 31682--><p class="indent" >  Jonas smiles.
</p><!--l. 31684--><p class="indent" >  “We do not consider it proper procedure to go over our heads.”
</p><!--l. 31686--><p class="indent" >  “Funny that you should talk about proper procedure,” he says.
</p><!--l. 31688--><p class="indent" >  “There is procedure and there is etiquette.”
</p><!--l. 31690--><p class="indent" >  “Yes.”
</p><!--l. 31692--><p class="indent" >  “So, you will withdraw the application.” It is not a question.
</p><!--l. 31694--><p class="indent" >  “You are cutting it a bit ﬁne.” Jonas looks at his watch, ceremonially. “But then the
ministry is rarely in a hurry.”
</p><!--l. 31697--><p class="indent" >  “The deadline has not passed.”
</p><!--l. 31699--><p class="indent" >  “Unfortunately, it is too late. We won&#x2019;t be able to make the deadline for withdrawal
now.”
</p><!--l. 31702--><p class="indent" >  “You have to cancel this,” he says with a certain imperative.

</p><!--l. 31704--><p class="indent" >  Jonas shrugs. “I would love to help, but I left the codes on a tablet on my
desk. I didn&#x2019;t synchronize them anywhere. We would have to go and ﬁnd
them.”
</p><!--l. 31708--><p class="indent" >  “Then that is what we shall do.”
</p><!--l. 31710--><p class="indent" >  “It isn&#x2019;t very convenient now,” Jonas smiles. “I have taken the afternoon
oﬀ.”
</p><!--l. 31713--><p class="indent" >  “Mr. Lindgren, you do understand that hindering the state could be considered an
oﬀence.”
</p><!--l. 31716--><p class="indent" >  “That would be criminal and irresponsible of me,” he issues ﬂatly. “Not my
style.”
</p><!--l. 31719--><p class="indent" >  “I have to warn you that, if you fail to cooperate, you could be arrested, and charges
could be brought against you.”
</p><!--l. 31722--><p class="indent" >  Jonas shrugs. “I don&#x2019;t think that will be necessary.”
</p><!--l. 31724--><p class="indent" >  “Good, then we shall go to your oﬃce now.”
</p><!--l. 31726--><p class="indent" >  Jonas looks at his wrist again. “People will have gone home now.”
</p><!--l. 31728--><p class="indent" >  “Stop procrastinating!” Larsen spits. “Come with us now. We are going in there to
cancel the order, before it goes through and I will need you to accompany me and

</p><!--l. 31732--><p class="indent" >  Jonas nods. “Very well”
</p><!--l. 31734--><p class="indent" >  They walk briskly through the park. Jonas does not drag his heels much beyond
what is involuntary sulking. They have a car and escort waiting, but it would be
quicker to walk back to his oﬃce, if truth be known. No matter, that is not his
concern. The car carries them through the town&#x2019;s traﬃc machine, the few blocks to the
small hill where the oﬃces of the Research Council are located and they step out into
the cobbled street.
</p><!--l. 31742--><p class="indent" >  The building looks dead now, though it is hard to tell from down here. Larsen and
his entourage herd him to the main entrance, where his mobile identiﬁes
him and a code opens the door. They pass through the empty reception and
summon the elevator. The metal-glass box lifts them to the ﬂoor where Jonas has
an oﬃce and deposits them in front of a new pair of glass doors. They are
locked.
</p><!--l. 31749--><p class="indent" >  A yellow cone with a stop sign is placed in front of the doors, and behind them,
they can see a man with a buﬃng machine working. A sign hangs on the
doors.

</p><!--l. 31762--><p class="indent" >  “Open the doors,” Larsen instructs.
</p><!--l. 31764--><p class="indent" >  Jonas shrugs. “I don&#x2019;t have keys to this door. The administration doesn&#x2019;t grant mere
employees keys to the building.”
</p><!--l. 31767--><p class="indent" >  “Mr. Larsen, don&#x2019;t waste time.”
</p><!--l. 31769--><p class="indent" >  “Really, I do not have the key to this door.”
</p><!--l. 31771--><p class="indent" >  He knocks on the glass doors to attract the attention of the man with the buﬃng
machine. If he hears, he does not respond.
</p><!--l. 31774--><p class="indent" >  “Isn&#x2019;t there someone we can call?”
</p><!--l. 31776--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t know the number of the company who cleans here.”
</p><!--l. 31778--><p class="indent" >  Larsen becomes agitated. “Can&#x2019;t you open this?”
</p><!--l. 31781--><p class="indent" >  “Not without a key.”
</p><!--l. 31783--><p class="indent" >  “Can we break in?”
</p><!--l. 31785--><p class="indent" >  The police oﬃcer makes a shake of his head. “I&#x2019;m afraid we don&#x2019;t have the
authority to do that. Mr. Larsen. Not without an order from the court.”
</p><!--l. 31789--><p class="indent" >  He grows red. “I am the government. We make the law!”
</p><!--l. 31791--><p class="indent" >  “Not today, sir.”
</p><!--l. 31793--><p class="indent" >  His face trembles with hatred and anger. He is bursting with some recrimination,
some threat of repercussion, but he manages to contain it. He prances back and forth
for several minutes, looking for some clue, but time is ticking on. There are no clues
here. He could try to ﬁnd out who is in charge, but Jonas knows that the cleaning staﬀ
will not part with their authority to close the ﬂoor lightly. There is actually little that
any of them can do now.
</p><!--l. 31801--><p class="indent" >  Apparently realizing the hopelessness of it, he swings around and storms out of the
building alone. He cannot get in. The building does not belong to any of
them.
</p><!--l. 31805--><p class="indent" >  Jonas smiles. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">So this time the victory will not be yours either. Today, the janitor has</span>
<span

<!--l. 31822--><p class="indent" >  Even after all this time, Den is still confused about the way Catalin Cortina treated
him. He is puzzled over her rejection of him as a man. It is not as if he tried to seduce
her, though even that would have been better than what transpired. He feels soiled
somehow by his encounter with her, and still he cannot quite escape the need to repair
the misunderstanding, to win her approval.
</p><!--l. 31829--><p class="indent" >  That vanity might be the source of his unease could not possibly occur to
him, for he has never seriously understood why other people, inclined along
alternative planes of thought, cannot simply extend their friendship with physical
intimacy, as would he in the same situation. When people allow themselves to be

seduced, either mentally or physically, everyone feels so much better afterwards.
Why would anyone bother to abstain? It is like a cessation of hostilities, a
bridge of trust—a private bond between souls, not some merely superﬁcial chit
chat.
</p><!--l. 31839--><p class="indent" >  Of course, this is simply the blindness of a man that comes about from an excessive
focus on his own performance. He is the Ptolemaic centre of his own universe:
everything else revolves around that focal point of self.
</p><!--l. 31844--><p class="indent" >  He sought to use Catalin Cortina as a fulcrum for his own ascension; instead she
gave him homework to do, as if her were little more than a naughty school boy. Now
he ﬂips between wanting to do the homework, to please the teacher, and wanting to
purge all thought of the woman from his mind.
</p><!--l. 31850--><p class="indent" >  A causal onlooker might ﬁnd the predicament an unreasonable and triﬂing
concern, and imagine him to be wallowing in an obsequious self-pity: but
that is only because they do not fully know him, or even begin understand
what makes him who he is. There are good reasons for his ambivalence. His
inner circle has noticed how he seems encumbered by a melancholy, but one
does not ask about the whys and wherefores of such things in this day and
age.
</p><!--l. 31858--><p class="indent" >  More than anything, he is unsatisﬁed with his own performance. He does not feel
that circumstances have allowed him to demonstrate his abilities. An omen of failure
hangs over him now, like a thief swinging in the gallows. Oddly, that thought weighs
upon him more than most. Is it a failure to impress? Failure to steer the course of
things? What is it?
</p><!--l. 31865--><p class="indent" >  Kylie McLachlan has been supportive in her tangential way, making fun of him, at
his expense. Her humour and casual courting will carry him through it; she is a friend.
And sensing his resilience, in spite of his wound, she has refrained from rubbing salt
in the real sore.
</p><!--l. 31870--><p class="indent" >  If Den has hoped to rule the world, then he cannot do it as long as he cares what
someone thinks about him.
</p><!--l. 31873--><p class="indent" >  Den looks at the invitation on his tablet screen.

<!--l. 31883--><p class="indent" >  Vascon. That&#x2019;s her, playing with him. Teasing him.
</p><!--l. 31885--><p class="indent" >  He could grow to despise her for that. And yet he knows that she knows that he
cannot strike back. The only way he could get back at her would be to beat her at her
own game, and that is exactly what she wants.

</p><!--l. 31890--><p class="indent" >  He is most inclined to simply do nothing.
</p><!--l. 31892--><p class="indent" >  Instinct tells him: he can neither go forwards nor backwards, nor choose between
the gods who have summoned him for their bidding. The only alternative is to stand
still, to carry on business as usual. Den the player had been played. And yet, as a
pawn in someone else game of chess, he will be discarded unless he is useful.
Circumstances seem to have drawn the burden of responsibility not merely around
him, but partially away from him; the religious factions have been backing oﬀ
somewhat, in the light of recent and certain revelations (no pun obviously
intended).
</p><!--l. 31902--><p class="indent" >  And, now that he is no longer their centre of attention, he feels oddly disoriented, as
if he has lost his compass bearing. Have the church leaders and their stooges gone
underground, into some doomsday crypt? Have they been arrested? He has not
received a single word from them or about them. Nor has there been any direct
communication from the government contractor, though that need not mean anything
other than that they expect their job done. Perhaps it is time to make a mark that
people will notice, once again?
</p><!--l. 31911--><p class="indent" >  Revenge? Pay-back? It would be a crude gesture, an unworthy gesture.
</p><!--l. 31914--><p class="indent" >  No, no need for that. The world needs directed imaging. He provides that
service better than anyone. Therefore he is needed. It is the simple logic of
commerce. So why does he not ﬁnd comfort in the syllogism? However he
shuﬄes his cards, he cannot help but feel uneasy: one day these government
level contracts might come to a close, then it will be back to catching small
ﬁsh.
</p><!--l. 31921--><p class="indent" >  For now, he will simply bide his time. Business as usual.
</p><!--l. 31923--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I don&#x2019;t know how to do anything else</span>, he thinks miserably. <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I don&#x2019;t know how to be</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">anyone else.</span>
</p><!--l. 31926--><p class="indent" >  Besides, there is nothing like a pre-arranged routine to legitimise the avoidance of
the present.
</p><!--l. 31929--><p class="indent" >  He ﬂips further down his list of other messages, weeding out the advertising, until
he comes to a report from his sister. She has been quiet of late. That is another thing
that makes him uneasy. Mary informs him simply that the missionary herd is still
moving forward through the game. Other than that, she is still engaged in some
exploratory work, but nothing on that yet.
</p><!--l. 31936--><p class="indent" >  Yeehah. So the work of the church is still on-going, even if it has, for the present,
been sucked almost entirely into the virtual realm. There is no stopping the word of
the Lord. Somewhere, they are still out there, and you can bet that men in black suits
will come knocking again. He is not sure whether that is a good thing or a bad thing.
Perhaps she can negotiate his formal contrition with the gods of fortune, as long as she
is out there.
</p><!--l. 31944--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Move on.</span>
</p><!--l. 31946--><p class="indent" >  Further down the list is another note about the bio-tech giant: Vascon.
</p><!--l. 31948--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Vascon, Vascon, Vascon.</span>
</p><!--l. 31950--><p class="indent" >  Companies rule the world today, but this is too much. There is no getting away

from the head that roars loudest, unless someone from the oﬃce is playing a trick on
him. The woman&#x2019;s tentacles seem to extend like creeping roots across half
the world, in some form or other. She is a genuine nexus of power, while
he is merely a wanna-be yea sayer. She has both wealth and inﬂuence. She
hangs in the shadows, lightly plucking the strings, while he is trying to tug
away on them. And on top of that, he is unable to dislike her. He admires
her.
</p><!--l. 31959--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Bitch.</span>
</p><!--l. 31961--><p class="indent" >  What he needs is a rest. A rest—and to talk to the one person who can both
sympathize with his feelings and advise him about his strategy towards Catalin
Constanca Alexandra Cortina: Celia Waites. After all, she was practically complicit in
placing him before this multi-headed hydra. It might not be exactly fair to use her as
his amateur psychologist, but it would certainly give him a legitimate reason to visit
her.
</p><!--l. 31969--><p class="indent" >  Yes, Celia.
</p><!--l. 31971--><p class="indent" >  Since bumping into her in San Diego, Den has found himself thinking a lot of her.
She has qualities—several qualities—that he admires greatly. She is elegant, demure,
sexy but vulnerable, and she has excellent taste. She was surely thinking of his best
interests when she connecting him to Cortina. That must be worth something in
return.
</p><!--l. 31977--><p class="indent" >  Suddenly he is swimming in a memory of their time together: a curious meeting of
minds and body, but wholly satisfying, unlike his short experience with Cathy Kim.
Where did she go?
</p><!--l. 31981--><p class="indent" >  But surely he has better things to do than to go half way around the world just to
satisfy his conscience? Well, not just his conscience. She is a fascinating woman and
he has a feeling that she will be glad to show him more than a few fascinating things
about herself. . .
</p><!--l. 31987--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">I don&#x2019;t know how to do anything else. I don&#x2019;t know how to be anyone else.</span>
</p><!--l. 31990--><p class="indent" >  Den sighs with something akin to resignation, or could it be recognition?
</p><!--l. 31992--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">“We have met the enemy, and he is us”, </span>he recalls reading.
</p><!--l. 31994--><p class="indent" >  He looks down at his tablet and pulls up a list of things to do on his calender.
Meetings, brainstorms, reports to write. It is all there: all he needs to ﬁll his head with
pointless emptiness. But that is not what he is going to do. He ﬂicks through it all
several times, up and down, looking at it with weary disinterest. He has formed a
diﬀerent plan, and he intends to say yea to it.
</p><!--l. 32001--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">No more procrastination.</span>
</p><!--l. 32003--><p class="indent" >  His clicks his acceptance of the Vascon invitation and it is mailed in return, then he
pulls up his directory. And now he is going to call Celia.
</p><!--l. 32007--><p class="indent" >  Yes.
</p><!--l. 32009--><p class="indent" >  He will call her.
</p><!--l. 32011--><p class="indent" >  He is going to call.

it.
</p><!--l. 32023--><p class="indent" >  “Hi it&#x2019;s Christina, can I come in?”
</p><!--l. 32025--><p class="indent" >  Christina? Dermot searches his mind to see if there is anyone—anyone else he

</p><!--l. 32030--><p class="indent" >  The search returns with failure and the inevitable conclusion sets his heart and mind

</p><!--l. 32033--><p class="indent" >  “Yes, yes, of course.” He is shocked. Confused. “Come in,” he says, clicking the

</p><!--l. 32036--><p class="indent" >  The ﬁgure that meets him from the stairwell is a study in tragedy. She is a skeleton,
thin to the point of malnutrition.
</p><!--l. 32039--><p class="indent" >  His imagination races through the possible causes. In a game, such a change could
be the result of disease or hardship: a lack of points scored in earlier rounds.
Could that also be the case here? Perhaps an eating disorder? Or poverty? She
was never very good with money. She was never very good at looking after
herself.
</p><!--l. 32045--><p class="indent" >  It is practically summer, but she is wearing a long black duﬄe coat to contrast with
her blond pallor. Her face seems greyer now; it is not merely pale. She has lost
something. It hurts him to see her like this: she is a dream that has developed a fault.
A tragic fair angel.
</p><!--l. 32050--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m not disturbing am I? Are you expecting someone?” She looks frightened,
unsure, a mere fragment of her former self.
</p><!--l. 32053--><p class="indent" >  “No, no.”
</p><!--l. 32055--><p class="indent" >  “I thought I would say hello. Is that okay?”
</p><!--l. 32057--><p class="indent" >  “Of course,” he says. “Wow. That&#x2019;s great. Can I get you some tea or something?”
</p><!--l. 32059--><p class="indent" >  She looks into his eyes, searching his face with an almost tearful insecurity, as if
she expects him somehow to be lying to her. “No thanks.”
</p><!--l. 32062--><p class="indent" >  “So how are you?” he musters, after too long an interval.
</p><!--l. 32064--><p class="indent" >  She smiles, uncertainly. She does not know how to answer. She simply shakes her
head slightly.
</p><!--l. 32067--><p class="indent" >  “Are you still living in the same place?” he fumbles, leading her to a sofa.
</p><!--l. 32070--><p class="indent" >  “A lot of strange things have been happening lately. So many strange things.”
</p><!--l. 32072--><p class="indent" >  “What kind of things?”
</p><!--l. 32074--><p class="indent" >  She looks at him with that look again, as if she is saying: are you one of them? Her
expression ﬂirts with paranoia.
</p><!--l. 32077--><p class="indent" >  Dermot might not be a king in the realm of social relationships, but he can
recognize the signs people make with their faces. He has always been better at looking

than engaging. There is something wrong here. Something has happened to her. She is
not animated in the same way as before. The parameters are diﬀerent. Something is
broken. And she is scared: frightened of what she might learn, from what he might
say.
</p><!--l. 32084--><p class="indent" >  “Just things,” she answers and looks suddenly worried. “Where is everyone?” She
stares ahead into space, occasionally glancing fearfully at him, as if to plead for his
permission to be there. He considers how he might answer, and to which
question.
</p><!--l. 32089--><p class="indent" >  “I don&#x2019;t know,” he says simply. “Who?”
</p><!--l. 32091--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s so quiet.” Then a shy smile ﬂickers across her mouth, as if sensing that her
worry is excessive. “So how are you?”
</p><!--l. 32094--><p class="indent" >  He nods. “I&#x2019;m okay. Too much to do.” He laughs, trying to lighten the mood.
“Always trying to do too much.”
</p><!--l. 32097--><p class="indent" >  “You&#x2019;re pretty smart, aren&#x2019;t you?”
</p><!--l. 32099--><p class="indent" >  He laughs again. “Well, I don&#x2019;t know about that. . . Hey, do you still see that friend
of yours?”
</p><!--l. 32102--><p class="indent" >  “As if anyone cared about me.” She sits, huddled into her duﬄe coat, thin as a rake,
her hands deep inside her pockets. “What are you watching?” She points to the
TV.
</p><!--l. 32106--><p class="indent" >  “News. I like to watch the news.”
</p><!--l. 32108--><p class="indent" >  “Is it war? A lot of funny things have been happening lately. It seems like we are at
war sometimes.”
</p><!--l. 32111--><p class="indent" >  He laughs, but she does not return the laugh. He wonders if she really means
it.
</p><!--l. 32114--><p class="indent" >  “Can I get you some tea? Are you sure? Would you like a piece of cake?”
</p><!--l. 32116--><p class="indent" >  “Cake?” She looks hopeful.
</p><!--l. 32118--><p class="indent" >  “I have some chocolate cake.”
</p><!--l. 32120--><p class="indent" >  She looks disappointed. “No thanks.”
</p><!--l. 32122--><p class="indent" >  “So do you still see your friend down in Little Asia much?”
</p><!--l. 32124--><p class="indent" >  She considers his question, as if dredging a slow computation from the bottom of
her mind. Her eventual response is not what he expects.
</p><!--l. 32127--><p class="indent" >  “I like the Chinese. They are sort of peaceful—and smart. They had this great
civilization.”
</p><!--l. 32130--><p class="indent" >  Dermot does not let go of his point. Perhaps she did not understand him. He knows
that she visited a friend down near all the Vietnamese restaurants. She was always
talking about it. “But you had a friend who lived down there. You used to visit him.
Do you still see him?”
</p><!--l. 32136--><p class="indent" >  She looks at him, examining him as if she is looking for some sign of betrayal or as
if he is talking a foreign language. Or is she blocking out his thoughts? It does not
compute.
</p><!--l. 32140--><p class="indent" >  “The Chinese built the wall, you know. It&#x2019;s supposed to be huge, visible from space.
I&#x2019;ve been going to the library you know.”
</p><!--l. 32143--><p class="indent" >  He nods. “That&#x2019;s right.”

</p><!--l. 32145--><p class="indent" >  “I used to go to the Deichmann a lot. I used to read. I didn&#x2019;t have anyone to talk to
so I used to talk to the people in the books.”
</p><!--l. 32148--><p class="indent" >  “Yeah, it&#x2019;s good to escape in books,” he injects, supportively.
</p><!--l. 32150--><p class="indent" >  “I like the library.”
</p><!--l. 32152--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s been a while since I was in a library,” he thinks out loud.
</p><!--l. 32154--><p class="indent" >  “It must be a good thing to read a lot. You&#x2019;re pretty smart, aren&#x2019;t you?”
</p><!--l. 32156--><p class="indent" >  He shrugs.
</p><!--l. 32158--><p class="indent" >  “Everyone would stare at me in the library. I think they hate me there.”
</p><!--l. 32160--><p class="indent" >  Dermot frowns. “Hate you? No they don&#x2019;t. Perhaps you feel that when you are
depressed, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean that it&#x2019;s true.”
</p><!--l. 32164--><p class="indent" >  She smiles momentarily, happy at his answer, but then the inﬁnitesimal intervention
of grace crumbles into fear once again.
</p><!--l. 32167--><p class="indent" >  “Anyway, how are you?”
</p><!--l. 32169--><p class="indent" >  He nods. “Okay. Okay, you know. I, eh, am working hard as usual. Thinking of
travelling now.”
</p><!--l. 32172--><p class="indent" >  “You have a pretty high IQ right?”
</p><!--l. 32174--><p class="indent" >  “I&#x2019;m not sure everyone would agree!” he laughs, more suspiciously this
time.
</p><!--l. 32177--><p class="indent" >  “You could be smart.”
</p><!--l. 32179--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">She must be desperately lonely</span>, he thinks, and feels a ﬂood of sympathy for her
now. He compares her ﬁgure with how she looked when he ﬁrst saw her, when all he
felt was blind yearning and searching admiration. It was he who was the misﬁt then.
She looked so normal, so much more respectable than he did. Now look at
her. What could happen to a person to transform them so? What could go so
wrong?
</p><!--l. 32186--><p class="indent" >  “So do you have someone that you talk to regularly?” he asks,
</p><!--l. 32188--><p class="indent" >  “You mean the doctors? They are all bastards. They think they can just tell you
what to do and manipulate you.”
</p><!--l. 32191--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Doctors?</span>
</p><!--l. 32193--><p class="indent" >  “They put me away for a while.”
</p><!--l. 32195--><p class="indent" >  “What about your parents?”
</p><!--l. 32197--><p class="indent" >  “Parents?”
</p><!--l. 32199--><p class="indent" >  “Didn&#x2019;t they live across the bay? In. . .what&#x2019;s it called. . .”
</p><!--l. 32201--><p class="indent" >  She shakes her head. “They&#x2019;re dead.”
</p><!--l. 32203--><p class="indent" >  He frowns. They are not dead. He saw her together with her mother before he broke
oﬀ his contact with her. Does that mean they are not talking to her? Surely parents
would not abandon their child, not even a diﬃcult one.
</p><!--l. 32207--><p class="indent" >  “Everyone is trying to manipulate you all the time, take advantage. It&#x2019;s not
fair.”
</p><!--l. 32210--><p class="indent" >  “Dead? How do you mean?”
</p><!--l. 32212--><p class="indent" >  “Doctors, pretending to care. They just take advantage of you.”
</p><!--l. 32214--><p class="indent" >  Dermot stores a dulled shock, as though someone is feeding a persistent and
persistently painful electric current through his body. Has someone taken advantage of

her? Is that what has tipped her over the edge? He is not sure what to believe. Earlier
he might have been unnerved by the thought of someone even touching her,
but his growing sense of disbelief has been dulled down even further with
endorphins.
</p><!--l. 32222--><p class="indent" >  “That&#x2019;s not good,” he says stupidly.
</p><!--l. 32224--><p class="indent" >  They sit in silence for a few minutes while she watches the images on the TV, and
Dermot struggles to prove that he is not mute.
</p><!--l. 32227--><p class="indent" >  “Why is it so quiet?”
</p><!--l. 32229--><p class="indent" >  He ﬂinches from his racing thoughts. “Sorry. My fault.”
</p><!--l. 32231--><p class="indent" >  “No, outside.”
</p><!--l. 32233--><p class="indent" >  He shrugs.
</p><!--l. 32235--><p class="indent" >  ”No one is around. I guess everyone is staying at home. It&#x2019;s Sunday.”
</p><!--l. 32237--><p class="indent" >  “Is it Sunday?.”
</p><!--l. 32239--><p class="indent" >  “Perhaps they are on holiday somewhere. Holiday.”
</p><!--l. 32241--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s weird, I mean without people. Is it a war?” She picks up a leaﬂet on his coﬀee
table and looks at it. “Are you joining the church?”
</p><!--l. 32245--><p class="indent" >  “Eh, no. I don&#x2019;t know.” He takes it from her and packs it away at the bottom of a
pile of papers, embarrassed. No one is supposed to see that.
</p><!--l. 32248--><p class="indent" >  “Someone told me to join too,” she says.
</p><!--l. 32250--><p class="indent" >  “Maybe it would give you something to do?” he suggests. A church would at least
give her someone to watch over her, something to be part of.
</p><!--l. 32253--><p class="indent" >  She shakes her head fearfully.
</p><!--l. 32255--><p class="indent" >  “Bad men.”
</p><!--l. 32257--><p class="indent" >  Dermot exhales, sensing an incumbent heaviness prey upon him. He resets his
mind, and summons his strategic faculties, realizing that he bears no emotional debt
toward her, but somehow feeling culpable. If the visit is disturbing, it merely conﬁrms
to him, once and for all, that he has made the right decision to walk away from her all
those months ago.
</p><!--l. 32264--><p class="indent" >  Pausing to chew his upper lip, he glazes over and extends into what seems
like a space behind her face, for a long moment, looking both through and
beyond her into his future—into her future. His imagination is easily up to such
prediction; he is used to making such analyses in games. And for a moment it is as
though time passes before him and a possible future it played out. It is a future
that he has seen before and which he knows only too well. It is something
that conﬁrms his belief that truth can be stranger than ﬁction and it holds
a terrible fascination for him. It is the impossible, and he has made it the
forbidden: an image that frightens him and fascinates him in equal measure. He
beholds it and acknowledges it. Then his wandering mind gradually re-contracts
back into the most immediate present, where she is trying not to watch him
stare.
</p><!--l. 32278--><p class="indent" >  He makes his decision.
</p><!--l. 32280--><p class="indent" >  Dermot takes her out to a local coﬀee shop and buys her something to eat. He is not
sure how else to make her leave, in a nice way. He tells her that he is expecting a

visitor soon and that he has to return home.
</p><!--l. 32284--><p class="indent" >  “I should get back home soon.”
</p><!--l. 32286--><p class="indent" >  She nods. “Everyone in the ﬂats pointed at me you know. When I came.”
</p><!--l. 32288--><p class="indent" >  “Attractive girl like you. They might look to catch a glimpse of you.”
</p><!--l. 32291--><p class="indent" >  She smiles.
</p><!--l. 32293--><p class="indent" >  “It&#x2019;s quiet. Are you sure it&#x2019;s not war?”
</p><!--l. 32295--><p class="indent" >  He looks at her head, so close to his, her emaciated face, her malnutrition. Inside
there is a brain, somehow damaged. What connections are missing from her program
to so distort her view of the world? What perceptions have emphasized the poor
judgement?
</p><!--l. 32300--><p class="indent" >  Is it the result of lethargy, inaction? Is it due to drug use, or lack of it? Is it a trauma
that has shut down some crucial circuit, or perhaps a conspiracy of parts in her brain
that have fragmented into independent, schizophrenic agents, all competing for
dominance, and all of them losing. On top, there is still a remnant of her former
beauty. She could be beautiful again. She has the framework, but not the
support.
</p><!--l. 32308--><p class="indent" >  If he were to provide some suﬃciently strong, unifying message, could he steer her
confusion back into some form of integrated sanity? It is a powerful idea. They have
done it for society, with the team. If they can do it for society, could they not do it for
the society of mind? If he took her and retrained her in basic skills, like a dog, could
those brain connections be re-established? Could she return to her former state of
grace?
</p><!--l. 32317--><p class="indent" >  “Your guest is coming,” she says. “Bye then.”
</p><!--l. 32319--><p class="indent" >  He nods.
</p><!--l. 32321--><p class="indent" >  “Come by sometime,” she says.
</p><!--l. 32323--><p class="indent" >  She walks oﬀ into the distance and Dermot wonders what he should do. She does
not look back at him, she simply walks oﬀ in the wrong direction for going home. She
has become a phantom, a lost soul.
</p><!--l. 32327--><p class="indent" >  <span 
class="ptmri7t-x-x-109">Can she be repaired? </span>he wonders.
</p><!--l. 32330--><p class="indent" >  He balks at the thought. Involvement would only mean a script for his own cerebral
imbalance. She would drag him down like a lead balloon towards a black
hole.
</p><!--l. 32334--><p class="indent" >  Dermot walks back towards his ﬂat. He will play some music and consider the
matter. For now, his logical mind serves only to inform him that his decision to keep
to himself is both justiﬁable and correct. Getting to know people is just too dangerous
a sport for someone like him.
</p><!--l. 32340--><p class="indent" >  One is better oﬀ alone.
</p><!--l. 32342--><p class="indent" >  Dermot closes the door behind him and tries to forget the incident. If he sees her
again, he will deal with it when the time comes.

He looks nervous or agitated, although it is diﬃcult to tell from this distance—and you can never tell what the hell these foreigners are thinking  What do you need all those keys for

Crystallizing in his panic, he watches the scene coldly, with a bitter fear, without interfering, without helping, without speaking up, without acting on his distress, without breathing or caring enough to act, without changing society or resolving to make it a better place

Her brother always used to say that, in small incestuous places like this, the whole village must be vampires, because if there were even one then everyone would be bitten by now

It is a pokey wooden bungalow with large windows, decorated in predictable Norwegian wood and linoleum ﬂooring, which tapers towards a plastic drain in the middle of the ﬂoor—almost as though they are expecting someone to take a shower right there in the middle of the room

The University of California in San Diego, UCSD has a beautiful campus, and the walk up the road from the guesthouse is pleasantly shady and cool, but Den has decided to take a swim in the pool before walking up to his meeting

As she turns around, satisﬁed with a job well done, he sees the bag of sweets still there and the camera zooms in, in slow motion, as his heart pounds and streaming saliva runs down his teeth like a pastiche of the classic Alien movies

Finally, he removed his hand and she put her hand on his shoulder to steady herself, and then ﬂed to a place where she could sit alone for a while and touch the spot where his hand had been

By the end of her degree, she felt as though she had transformed her view of the world, but she was weary of machines and their virtual worlds and felt that there must be more that she could apply her skills to

It seemed like an odd thing to do, developing little robots to wander around the Norwegian mountains, but where better to test such technologies than in a place where there is both highly variable terrain and suﬃcient human infrastructure to keep tabs on them

advisors from Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia were engaged to design scenery and advertising styles, as well as to decide on the boundaries for allowed behaviour—what users logged on from diﬀerent regions would be allowed to see and do

Peace activists argue that, by providing agency-sponsored war games for kids at home, the game designers could keep Americans and their allies attuned to the idea of violent intervention, paving the acceptance for future military interventions when necessary

His position in this assembly is now reinforced and cleansed of its tainting graﬃti, as if he has been purged of witchery, or an unsightly stain on his suit has been skillfully erased by his silver tongue

We need to be able to compare the patterns of usage in the game in other parts of the world with what is going on here, to see how it correlates with the information feeds

I thought of you because I know that you have access to the roaming agents that your company has developed to pick up on trends in the game, and that you have the right kind of overview

As he arrives, she is already waiting, legs together, but outstretched to the pavement, leaning forward, dressed in the usual black gear which contrasts with the many coloured stripes in her bleach-blonde hair

But if someone is making a new protocol then it means they have come up with some new hardware or software that they hope is going to win against the competition

One of the Ivy League colleges built a system for them to work like a virtual machine with certain policy based constraints, so willing ﬁghters can use their cognitive abilities to remote control certain slow robots

As far as he understands it, the architecture is such that if one of the packages becomes so successful as to attract too many occupants, these processors become overloaded and one of two contingencies ensues

The trouble is that our mobiles have put us in touch with a much larger number than that, and so people are starting to be more selective in who they talk to

Not only that, but they can have private conversations that are not really bound to a physical reality where you get all those important physical signals that tell you when you are doing something wrong

Even when there has been corporate corruption in the past, there has been enough consensus in society to hold the governmental power base of these rich people and keep the country together, because the basic illusion was focused around a single centre of power

Thing is, then they have all fallen into the trap and you can start to manipulate them less subtlety, to gain power, by changing the collective attitude to whatever you please

The churches are pretty annoyed, you see, that secular politics has all but stripped them of their power over the years, so they have been formulating strategies to win in politics for a long time

Here the power lines seem to be hung up like washing lines in the shanty commune, haphazardly hooked over poles that look like shaven cacti and pass through crumbling plaster into these shacks

It begins in bursts, showing the overly made-up face of what is presumably the candidate for the election – Den cannot honestly say that he has seen this man before, nor does he much care

You are not seriously telling me you believe our own propaganda—that, by putting people into a safe environment where they all can meet and play together, that you will promote peace and understanding

He begins to run through his routines for impressing people at dinner parties, a few anecdotes for a suitable occasion, a menu of discussion topics to steer the conversation without making him appear single-minded or boring

He cannot identify exactly what it is about her, but there is no doubt that she is both attractive and alluring and he wants to see her some more before his visit is over

Well I just think it is marvellous that this game is under the guiding hand of such a great man as our president, chosen by God she says with the kind of conviction that a TV ad or tortured prisoner might redeem

America is suﬀering from civil unrest in several states due to the increasingly right wing detachment of the government, but the last place he expects to hear this kind of open criticism is here

She crawls out of the small window in her room and clambers through tall wet grass and marshy mosses to the trail, hoping that she can get far enough away before someone notices that she is gone

It is an ironic turn of events that the genetically manipulated plants introduced here to provide a fuel source for the larger VeiVeks, could be reprogrammed almost as soon as they are introduced in to nature by the increased radiation

But it was her father, before he died, whose encouragement ﬁlled her with the approval to take a chance on her convictions—to pursue science as an adventure, not as a bureaucratic penance, that would bring more aggravation than comfort

Now that their central controller has gone away, they have started to make the best of what little communication they can to establish contact with their neighbours, to solicit help when needed

And yet it was the indulgent folly of her enquiring mind that brought her here, along an unlikely trail, far from that shepherded upbringing to this virtual sweat shop, to a new and completely diﬀerent country

Her teachers have taught her the power of simulation here at the University in Kuala Lumpur, and she has found that it is a considerable help in ﬁguring out the chains of cause and eﬀect within the program

That a fragment of an idea, half held in a moment of inspiration could steer the course of an unencumbered human being, from one side of the planet to another, hardly bears serious consideration, and yet this is what is about to transpire in the most peculiar of ways for her

The swerving subsides, as if the van is driving in more of a straight line, but the white ﬂames of fear explode inside her as the strong hands holding her legs and ankles pull apart her legs

As she looks down at herself, she thinks about escaping from this place, from her heritage, from her life—to a place where she could have herself and wear ﬁne perfumes and sleep for six hours at a time

We have kept this under control for a long time, but then with the failure of the Patriot act and the civil liberties trials undermining our powers in reigning in the terrorists, our main crisis today has become the breakdown of order

We would not have started this project if it were not for the beneﬁt this will have to hundreds of thousands, eventually millions of people all over the world, in bringing them closer to a free world

Den guesses that they are talking about the Institute for Propaganda Analysis, but he is always amazed by how Americans talk in three letter abbreviations without realizing they have many possible interpretations

s lack of critical reasoning, that he wrote a book, The Phantom Public, in which he said that the public had essentially no role to play in the governance of society, in government, because they were just too pig ignorant

It is not even supposed to be possible, but like most software the game is not very well written, and she could do it if she pleased

Usually, they begin their meetings with a friendly game of hide and seek, to see who can fool the other for the longest time, though this game has been wearing a little thin of late

Bea has lately been seeing someone she met on a one-nighter, and Vibe has been tied up with work, trying to ﬁgure out what is going on with the VeiVeks

Fortunately, in the supervisor levels, where she and Bea have learned how to exist, the programmers apparently have a sense of humour and have arranged some ﬁlters for themselves that make the Christian mythology more like kitschy humour than anything else

Is it really worth the risk of getting shot up with paint-balls, just to see this person, who probably has no idea who she is, or why he is important to her canx

Sara smiles cheekily to the desk help, swishing her long hair aside, as she walks past and follows the cabin around from the reception to the lounge to the dining room, where the predictable mountain breakfast buﬀet is waiting

She has been caught unawares in bad weather before, been so cold to the bone that even the slightest movement hurt, and those parts of her body which could still feel at all, were tender to the slightest touch

a world in which people ﬂow like blood through little arterial corridors, arriving in brightly coloured vessels, carrying this breath, this life-force into and out of a weary angina-ridden pump, docking with the alveoli of its pulmonary terminals to recharge them for a new journey

She is well acquainted with the ways in which the Indian government has twisted words and arguments to get their way—to convince the people that they are really working in their best interests, when really they are just feathering the nests of the ruling elite

She found her way as far as Bangalore, by catching a lift with a fat man who looked at her small frame with an ugly repressed hunger, so clearly signalled by his shortness of breath and barking suggestion

She tells her X that she does not want to give up her travel credentials, that she has not been able to ﬁnd any clothes to buy

laissez-faire dream, which the Chilean Pinochet thrust upon feudal poverty in South America, turning the country into a power house of short-lived productivity and ending it with a new class of Those Who Haves and of Those Who Have Nots

That man might think he is in control, but one day the elastic will be stretched to its limit and she will snap back at him with a killing force

Others in the bar are starting to stare and predictably a bouncer is making his way through the crowded bar to eject the pair into the outside world where they will be able to continue the abuse in the privacy of Oslox

He told me that there is no sense in banging your head against the wall, when all they want is cheap feel-good recipes that they can follow without question

Back in the s, John Von Neumann dreamed that we would be able to control the weather, using computers to make accurate predictions, but even he probably realized that there was only a slim chance of being able to describe it accurately enough

They give her a key and a new mobile and tell her not to use the old one, because you never know what someone might have done to such an accessible electronic collar

They talk about the game and about her work, about how the diagnostic traces that their software in Kuala Lumpur has been able to perform have seen a pattern of behaviour in the game, the same pattern that she has been following for some time, the same pattern that they have been discussing

If this were one of those bloody robots you send to Mars or whatever you do, you would be over there in ﬂash, but if I ask you to do one little thing you canx

He is far from old—his mid-forties are clinging on to him, but there is something about the protective enclosure of his apartment, with his books and his music that makes him feel safe and sheltered

As soon as he is through that door, the fear passes and he is ﬁne again, but there is a moment in stepping over the threshold that is getting harder and harder for him to endure

It is jammed in, next to a ﬂower shop that spills over into the mall entrance with seasonal ﬂowers in whites and reds, and purples, broadcasting aromas to mingle with wisps of brewing coﬀee

She is crying, looking around at the people walking by helplessly, as if woken from a deep hypnosis, thrust suddenly into the jaws of reality, and feeling so utterly alone that she must beg the faceless ﬂock for their attention, for their assistance

If truth be known, Jonas is secretly pleased to have this opportunity to walk along Karl Johan with his boy, through the main streets of Oslo, with his little four year old

, in the title you quoted, does not refer to the virtual reality game, as in these virtual reality games that you seem to be referring to

And as long as a mobile signal breaks through the weather, Vibe uses the time in the bag to relay her position to cabin and to her team-mates whom she was supposed to be heading towards, and do a little research

Even through the snow-buried bag, she can see that it is a bright, ﬁne morning, which is good because she really has to crawl the hell out of this thing now to tend to her aching bladder

Also, if the individual agents discovered something of value that they were investigating, that should be able to take priority of a central command signal, at least until some Earth-bound human policy maker could override it

But they have also seen that the merest rumour planted into the network of gamers can send them all on some quest for glory, each of them imagining that they are the chosen one to do something diﬀerent

When a young girl looks as good as she does, is smart and sexy and playful, there is no male in the universe that can say no to her, especially if she discretely ﬂashes some ﬂesh

The aim of this meeting was to let us all meet one another and to maybe hear some ideas about the problems that we are seeing, and how we are going to make use of Preetax

I have talked to the group in San Diego, and they are trying to make out that this is an administrative error, but I think that, if you look at the code, you have to see that this is a deliberate attempt to add a veto and replacement message

So the upshot is that all of these messages are having a real eﬀect on what is going on out there, and that means we cannot discount the possibility of the kind of thing that Preeta has experienced coming here to Oslo

Of course, originally no one thought that anyone would be able to ﬁgure out what is really going on in such a huge enterprise, nor be able to do anything about it even if they could

It has always seemed preferable to orchestrate the activities from his private home in the High Wycombe countryside, where he can look out across the misty hills and count sheep as he works

Go quiet in the push and shoveGo bold where no person has gone beforeDo it fast and furiousDo it thorough and goodDo it calm and thoughtfulSpeak clear of good meaning intentionsAnd meet every new soul real peaceful,Salute, them respectful, likeShips passing quiet in the night

Now, if she can somehow pack the mud underneath her, to get enough friction to press with her calves, she could release one hand and try to get out of her backpack, which is pinning her down

It sears at her hip, with all her body weight supported by the friction of her hip and buttock, but it feels solid enough to roll onto her stomach and clutch at grass and shrubs with her hands

Part of the Mars programming they are testing out is to prevent them from moving too far apart for too long, so that they do not lose contact with one another

The only thing she can remember is that she is going to fail her doctorate, that her work is doomed and that they are after her

There are players all over the game who have paid to kill and maim and be lawless, and he wants to tell them all that they are morally bankrupt and that they should all hail the police as the saviours of society

ve got griefers messing up their game scenarios in the sims to pot—but that is not the same thing as having the evangelical churches manipulate the games for their own gain

She does not look at him as she says the words, instead she walks to a small kitchen and starts routing around in some old dishes for cups

He ﬁddles with the combo for a while longer to make sure there is not something trivial wrong then, seeing that she is no longer interested, gives in

In these winter months, you have to be fairly hard core to march down a street or hang out on a corner, simply to show your allegiance or deﬁance, or whatever the hell it is they are trying to show

s when the stars so bright  Do nightly scintill  If watchful providence be  With good intentions fraught  Should not keep up her watch divine  We soon should come to nought

Maybe one day, if she ever settles somewhere and becomes happy, if she ever feels safe, then she will discover who she really is—not just who someone else wants her to be

A small text ﬂashes up to tell her that she will soon be entering an isolated multi-player game cell, that she should defend herself using only weapons that she ﬁnds there

According to the system, she has been correlated with several activities, She came up on mountain rescue violations, maﬁa threats, an American complaint about attempting to sabotage an experiment, and a police report somewhere recently

It is no longer necessary to look over her shoulder at every moment, wondering if someone is out to destroy her, or abuse her, or abduct her

She moves back into the ﬂow of people and is almost carried through the arcade to the exit and ejected back into the street, next to what looks like cloisters of a church

She pulls some easy training clothes out of her pack, some light shoes and starts the sluggish process of folding her body into maneuvers that ought to be straightforward

She would have preferred it if they had looked like the French team, but her imagination is good enough to think of them as French team with plastic surgery

She has been thinking about the French team for so long that she must at least try to see them before changing her obsession

The strategy is to trace their activities over time, learn who their friends are and then make them think that they are letting their closest friends and parents down by not acting in their countryx

These religious groups might not want to promote war, but they do want to have absolute control by essentially rendering everyone passive and be accepting of the guidance they receive from their leaders

From what we have seen, there are those who simply want to keep people ﬁghting in the game, to keep them open to the use of violence to solve Americax

Everything we hear these days is telling us that the West is going to have to sacriﬁce its position of privilege, to make way for better human rights in other countries, and allow the developing world to have a larger share of the cake

So, each night, her friend would reveal to her a single piece of the puzzle, laying out the jigsaw of a grand design in front of her, almost as if testing her, tasking her to make the leap, to take the job

She knew that it was wrong to talk about her work with anyone, even the help-desk staﬀ, but he would feed her morsels of information about the greater plan, building her trust, so she had to reciprocate

It has all come full circle – from the time when men were individual savages, having to ﬁght for their comfort, to the present time of the selﬁsh mobile communicator, no longer able to forge proper relationships

They have not given him much time to act, and he is damned if he is going to let friends and colleagues be submitted in this roughshod trampling without some kind of armour

Later still, they sit around at the conference banquet, eating by themselves and pretending not to look uncomfortable, if they cannot ﬁnd a group in which they can repeat the same all over again

The tugging in his chest tells him that he is still ensnared by her somehow, but he also knows himself well enough to know that any graceful female body could distract him at any time

So she made the introductions for him and dates were exchanged by her secretary, and two days later he found himself on a ﬂight to Madrid, looking forward to better weather than that he returned to in London

Utopia is not a word that Den would normally associate with this part of the world, as much on principle as for its uncomfortable summer climate, and yet he recognizes, in each facet of the estate, the ingredients of a grand vision, a vision of perfection

He senses a mood of ﬁghting back, against the establishment, and yet it would never have occurred to him that anyone could so blatantly revile the accepted mood of the generation, and thrive along side it

Maria leaves him inside the entrance to the mail building, and returns to her station at the reception, allowing him to splash water on his amazement and ponder his visage in a washroom mirror

She has a slender ﬁgure, but she is not thin, and her long auburn hair hangs loosely around her shoulders, not even pushed behind her ears, as if she is at peace with the idea of sharing her space with something that lives a life of its own

I want the ideology, which is spread, to be one that is based on critical discussion, ideas, crazy passions and rational thinking, all together – not pea-brained propaganda and certainly not if it leads to a massive increase in power for the forces of ignorance

The trouble with the old centralized system, which is essentially bureaucratic, is that it cannot solve problems – increasing bureaucratic controls simply creates more and more preconditions for corruption

They are ﬁve puﬀed up blimps feeling their way forward, towards the a place rumoured to be known to one of them, none of them certain of where they are going

It is amazing that a single voice can be heard over this din, truly a testament to the power of the human brain to focus on a single message when shrouded in static

People are selﬁsh today – why would they invest in something like a church, where there is a congregation you have to take care of, unless it gave them something for free

The real sound of violence is a hollow smack, as ﬂesh gives way to sudden impact, followed by the splatter of thin red blood onto the wooden ﬂoorboards, drying in little craters, which darken to crimson

She lifts out her hand in a regal beckoning as she dances as if to invite him into an unholy trinity, inviting him to share in her adventure, but he is paralysed

She wants to go to him, but the girl in front of her is now pressing in close running her hands down her back, which seems like an opportunity that is too good to miss

because non-experts want to feel as though they have some kind of control over what we are going to be doing with our time and what they are going to be out of it

You say you are going to, you set up all the procedures and formal machinations to take care of the debate, and then you just dump the results in the waste-paper basket

Well then, you already know that the worst way to try to make someone do something is to tell them they have to

Steroid Sally stands is poise, as a rock would poise, in the entrance to the lounge, with face-lift pony-tail sucking her backwards, and cold blue eyes avoiding those of the only person in the room

Law and order, the world over, is going down the tubes, largely due to the fact that people no longer see the need to rely on one another as citizens

The good news is that all of the money that we were forced into spending on anti-terrorism measures, to appease the United States, in the early years of this century, is now proving to be a good investment for helping us with the gangs

We have a huge problem in some areas with police thinking that they are above the rest of society and that the law basically does not apply to them – they can park their cars in a no-stopping street

But, of all the things that ought to be occupying his mind, at this moment, all he can think about is how he can persuade Ms Cortina that his intentions are honourable

We have to show better judgement in the kinds of message we expose our people to if we are going to preserve this lifestyle that we all take for granted

You buy food for a dinner party and then have to force each of your guests to pay the same amount that you paid for the food, because it is licensed to the manufacturer, otherwise the food will not release its nutrients

The music penetrates him, violates his defences, and works its cleansing magic as if the experience of this tortured symphony is a deeply acting antibiotic for his personal strife, using up all of his emotions

There is no way back without hurting everyone who means something to you, and there is no way forward because there are immovable obstacles in your way

She could probably ﬁnd out all about her and even work a little magic, but the last thing she wants to do is to draw attention to herself in her ﬁrst few days

The central node is still obliged to do as much work as before, but the chance of keeping all its agreements is much smaller, because the likelihood of the other agreements being broken is so much greater

He once said that it was true enough that the raping and pillaging of the Vikings did not count as declaring war since it was just individual misadventure, not sanctioned by the state

In the past few weeks, she has not only ﬂed from responsibility into an unknown future, merely for her own selﬁsh gain, she has broken every imaginable taboo from her upbringing

Den is no angel when it comes to sticking to a single partner, but he has never bullied anyone, never been violent or made a promise that he broke

She is a work of art, there is no doubt about that, yet somehow he does not feel the same thrill at meeting her that he has done in the past

Preeta has not been back for several days after her ﬂing on the town, and he has not been motivated to ﬁgure things out without her

a school child who has been asked to comment on the meaning of Keats except that, where such humanities left him only confused and unmoved, these stanzas burst with meaning, both intriguing and logical

It is hard to work here, with the bustling interruption of the customers, but it is pleasant until someone opens the door and douses them with icicles of frozen air that stab at their bare skin

t look at me because you are nothing and I am not willing to put my judgement on hold until I can no longer take responsibility for my actions and literally anyone will do

She does not look at him or give any sign of being interested and yet she presents him now with this revelation as though he is supposed to know what it signiﬁes

You know, after I had my kid I wanted to know what it would be like to have sex – you know, whether I would be able to feel anything, or if it would be any diﬀerent from before

His interest is purely in moving up the food chain, by shifting the economic game pieces around the board so that government ministries can feel good about their half-assed pledges to the media

He ﬁnds himself becoming impatient with the process, approaching a point at which he must decide whether or not to allow himself to become angry, or whether to suppress the urge and maintain his equanimity

So when a government from one of the richest countries in the world comes and tells you that you have to divert funds from research to famine relief, you know that they are covering up something

Finally, that hard earned knowledge gets passed on to those who have not toiled and struggled for it, to those who have not tasted the sweat on their brows or the thrill of understanding

If trust in the delegation of responsibility breaks down, if the roles are not carried out properly, the system itself breaks down, and no one can ﬁx it, because they no longer have the skills to do anyone elsex

If you can ﬁll out this form by the end of the day so that I have it by tomorrow morning, I can bring the matter to the attention of the European Parliament, who might be able to bear some inﬂuence on the matter

There is little she can do, with or without Mickey Mouse ears or a pointy hat, but if enthusiasm were a key, then they would have enough of them to build a piano from here to Mars and back

*  For the ﬁrst days of Advent, one might have been expecting angels to herald its onslaught, but angels are the scum of the VR, not the glowing portents of new things to come

Even Jonas Lindgren has made the eﬀort to come and see their work in person, to impute the values of science to the champagne launch, to lend it the authority of the sceptic

His aid mumbles, almost to himself, apparently in more distress than the senator himself, and almost as if he believes that the senator is not really listening to him—which is probably true

s many signals were to heal and unite people, if it were to be a unifying force for good, strengthening and educating people rather than driving them apart, it would signal an end to their power

It would make an interesting research project to follow who is doing what to make it all work, but they have to simply take it on trust for now

That vanity might be the source of his unease could not possibly occur to him, for he has never seriously understood why other people, inclined along alternative planes of thought, cannot simply extend their friendship with physical intimacy, as would he in the same situation

If the visit is disturbing, it merely conﬁrms to him, once and for all, that he has made the right decision to walk away from her all those months ago

Pausing to chew his upper lip, he glazes over and extends into what seems like a space behind her face, for a long moment, looking both through and beyond her into his future—into her future

Is it a trauma that has shut down some crucial circuit, or perhaps a conspiracy of parts in her brain that have fragmented into independent, schizophrenic agents, all competing for dominance, and all of them losing
